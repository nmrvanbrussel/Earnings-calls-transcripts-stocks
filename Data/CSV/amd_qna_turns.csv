I guess I'll just ask it right out of the gate is, as we think about the GPU business, and I appreciate you talked about delivering north of $5 billion of revenue, which is extremely impressive in 2024. I'm curious if you -- how we should think about framing the GPU, the instinct business, as we think about 2025? And any kind of color you can provide us as far as kind of the progression of revenue, the pace of revenue first half versus second half as we think about some of the product cycle dynamics. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, first of all, look we were very pleased with how we finished 2024 in terms of the data center GPU business. I think the ramp was steep as we went throughout the year, and the team executed well. Going into 2025, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are actually very happy with the progress that we're making on both the hardware road maps and the software road maps. So, on the hardware side, we launched MI325 at the end of the fourth quarter, started shipments then. We have new designs that have come on both MI300 and MI325 that we'll deploy in the first half of the year. And then the big news is on the MI350 series. So, we had previously stated that we thought we would launch that in the second half of the year. And frankly, that bring-up has come up better than we expected, and there is very strong customer demand for that. So, we are actually going to pull that production ramp into the middle of the year, which improves our relative competitiveness. So, as it relates to how data center -- so the overall data center business will grow strong double digits certainly, both the server product line as well as the data center GPU product line will grow strong double digits. And from the shape of the revenue you would expect that the second half would be stronger than the first half, just given MI350 will be a catalyst for the data center GPU business. But overall, I think we are very pleased with the trajectory of the data center business in both 2024 and then going into full year 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And as a quick follow-up, just thinking about the guidance overall relative to that down 7% sequential I know you mentioned seasonality across the business segments. Are you assuming that you are down sequentially in data center in total in 1Q? And how do I frame that relative to seasonality? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Aaron. So, let me give you some more color on the Q1 guide. So, Q1 guide was down 7% sequentially, as Jean mentioned. And the way that breaks out in each of the segments assume that data center would be down just about that average, so the corporate average. We would expect the client business and the embedded business to be down more than that. Just given where seasonality is for those businesses. And then we would expect gaming business will be down a little less than that. And that's a little atypical from a seasonality standpoint, but we are coming off of a year when there was a lot of let's call it, inventory normalization. And now that inventory has normalized, we would expect that that would be down a little bit less than the corporate average. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

I wanted to ask about the server CPU business. Jean, I think you have said in the past that core count is going to grow mid- to high teens. And as long as your competitor is not super aggressive on pricing that your business should grow roughly that much as well. Are you expecting or are you already seeing them become a little more aggressive on pricing as they attempt to shore up their share? It sounds like they're getting a bit more aggressive on pricing. So, wondering if you still think that the server CPU business can grow in line with that core kind of mid- to high teens.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think the way to look at our Q4 performance is our data center business overall did really well. It actually is consistent with our expectations. Of course, when we look at the server and the data center GPU, server did better than data center GPU.

Maybe I'll just add, Tim, on your question as to what you would expect as we go into 2025. I think you should assume that the first half of 2025 data center segment will be consistent with the second half of '24.

Lisa, a few questions on the data center GPU business. I think last year, AMD was very explicit about setting and beating or meeting expectations. This year, you have not set a specific forecast, and I'm curious what has changed. And then if I go back to your Analyst Day in December, I think at that time, you are sort of long-term 60% CAGR. Is it fair to assume that you can grow at that for '25, right, versus the $5 billion-plus that you did last year? So, just contrast the two years and then whether AMD can grow at that 60% trend line.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,11,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, Vivek, thanks for the question. I think what we look at is certainly for the first year of the data center GPU business, we wanted to give some clear progression as it was going. The business is now at scale, actually now at over $5 billion. And as we go into 2025, I think our guidance will be more at the segment level with some color as to some qualitative color as to what's going on between the two businesses. And relative to your question about long-term growth rates, you are absolutely right. I mean, I believe that the demand for AI compute is strong. And we've talked about a data center accelerator TAM upwards of $500 billion by the time we get out to 2028. I think all of the recent data points would suggest that there is a strong demand out there. Without guiding for a specific number in 2025, one of the comments that we made is we see this business growing to tens of billions, as we go through the next couple of years. And that gives you a view of the confidence that we have in the business and particularly our road map is getting stronger with each generation, right? So MI300 was a great start. MI350 series is stronger and addresses a broader set of workloads including both inference as well as training. And then as we get into MI400 series, we see significant traction and excitement around what we can do there with rackscale designs and address the innovation that's going on there. So, yes, we are bullish on the long term, and we'll certainly give you progress as we go through each quarter in 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, I would love your perspective on the news from DeepSeek recently, right? And there are kind of two parts to that. One is once you heard the news, do you think that should make us more confident or more conservative about the semiconductor opportunity going forward? Like is there something so disruptive in what they have done, that reduces the overall market opportunity? And then within that, have your views about GPU versus ASIC how that share develops over the next few years? Have those evolved in any way at all? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,13,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Vivek. Yes, it's been a pretty exciting first few weeks of the year. I think the DeepSeek announcements, Allen Institute as well as some of the Stargate announcements, talk about just how much the rate and pace of innovation that's happening in the AI world. So, specifically relative to DeepSeek, look, we think that innovation on the models and the algorithms is good for AI adoption. The fact that there are new ways to bring about training and inference capabilities with less infrastructure actually is a good thing because it allows us to continue to deploy AI compute and broader application space and more adoption. I think from our standpoint, we also like very much the fact that – we are big believers in open source. And from that standpoint, having open-source models, looking at the rate and pace of adoption there, I think is pretty amazing. And that is how we expect things to go. So, to the overall question of how should we feel about it, I mean, we feel bullish about the overall cycle. And similarly, on some of the infrastructure investments that were announced with open AI and Stargate and building out, let's call it, massive infrastructure for next-generation AI. I think all of those say that AI is certainly on the very steep part of the curve. And as a result, we should expect a lot more innovation. And then on the ASIC point, let me address that because I think that is also a place where there is a good amount of discussion. I've always been a believer in you need the right compute for the right workload. And so, with AI, given the diversity of workloads, large models, media models, small models, training, inference when you are talking about broad foundational models or very specific models, you're going to need all types of compute. And that includes CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs. Relative to our $500 billion-plus TAM going out in time, we've always had ASIC as a piece of that. But my belief is, given how much change there is still going on in AI algorithms that ASICs will still be the smaller part of that TAM because it is a more, call it, specific workload-optimized, whereas GPUs will enable significant programmability and adjustments to all of these algorithm changes. But when I look at the AMD portfolio, it really is across all of those pieces. So, CPUs, GPUs. And we are also involved in a number of ASIC conversations, as well as customers want to really have an overall compute partner.

Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, it was good to see MI355X pulled into midyear. But I wanted to clarify, you said first half '25 data center GPU likely consistent with second half '24, and I was wondering if you could speak to whether or not the shape of the first half changed over the last few months and is potentially related to this pulled in timeline, it could be a potential air pocket ahead of that launch, or this was sort of consistent with how you saw things playing out as MI350 and MI325X ramps more fully?

Thanks for the question, Joshua. No, I would say from our standpoint, we've gotten incrementally more positive on the 2025 data center GPU ramp. I think MI350 series was in second half always, but pulling it into midyear is an incremental positive. And from a first-half, second-half statement, as I mentioned, we have some new important AI design wins that are going to be deployed with and MI300 and MI325 in the first half of the year. But with MI350 series, we end up with more content. I mean, it is a more powerful GPU, ASPs go up, and you would expect larger deployments that include training and inference in that time frame. So, the shape is similar to what we would have expected before.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And believe it or not, I could ask a question on client. Obviously, the growth number in the fourth quarter, I mean, it was certainly higher than our model. Could you clarify the drivers of the strength across desktop, notebook, and enterprise and how we should think about 1Q, and in particular, to put it bluntly, I mean, are you worried at all about inventory buildup given how much your client revenue has outperformed the broader PC market in the second half of the year?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,17,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks for the question. Our client business performed really well throughout 2024 and Q4 was a very strong quarter. There are a couple of reasons for that. So, we should go through that. We don't believe there is some substantial inventory buildup. We actually think that what we're seeing is very strong adoption of our new products. So, on the desktop side, we saw our highest sell-out in many years, as we went through the holiday season, launching our new gaming CPUs, frankly, they have been constrained in the market, and we've continued shipping very strongly through the month of January as we are catching up with some demand there. So, desktop business was very strong. And on the notebook side, we also saw a number of our OEM partners launching new AI PCs with the slew of new bulk mobile part numbers that we announced at CES. We have our strongest PC portfolio on the mobile side with top-to-bottom Copilot+ PC-compatible products, and those are playing very well into the market. So, I think Q4 was strong. I know that there was some commentary about whether there were pull-ins relative to tariffs. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter. I think, as I said, we saw strong sellout. Going into the first quarter, we do expect seasonality in there. But the part of our business that is performing better than seasonality is the desktop portion of the business. And the mobile portion of the business is, let's call it, more typical seasonality. But overall, I think we are very bullish on our prospects to grow clients in 2025. Just given all of the drivers from product portfolio to some of the market dynamics, as well as our new commercial PCs portfolio.

Thanks for taking my question. For the fourth quarter, did your overall server CPU business grow double digits sequentially? And as a follow-on to that, I think Q4 was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year increases for your on-prem service solutions. On a sequential basis, I know you guys did start to see recovery in enterprise in the second quarter of last year, I think it was strongly up sequentially in the third quarter, a pretty broad base. Did enterprise service grow sequentially in Q4? And Lisa, how do you see the share prospects in this segment as you step into 2025?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,19,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Harlan, thanks for the question. So, I think as Jean mentioned earlier, so in the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential double-digit growth in our server business. We saw that in both cloud and enterprise. I think the server business has been performing extremely well. We are continuing to grow our cloud footprint with more workloads, as we have the strength of the churn portfolio in addition to Genoa and Milan. And then to your question on enterprise, I do believe we are seeing some strong traction in the enterprise. I think what's helping us there is, frankly, we've invested a lot more in go-to-market and the go-to-market investments are paying off. The enterprise sales cycle is often a six-month to nine-month sales cycle. But as we've invested more resources in it throughout 2024, we've seen that convert into a significant number of new POCs that are now converting into volume deployments. And as we go through into 2025, from a competitiveness standpoint, we have a very strong portfolio across every price point, every core count, every workload. So, I think, we see a strong 2025 for server CPUs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Networking is a very critical part of the AI infrastructure becoming even more important. There seems to be this misconception that AMD is behind the curve here, you're keeping pace kind of leveraging the incumbent Ethernet technology, strong installed ecosystem. You guys are spearheading the UltraNET Ethernet Consortium. You've got your Infinity Fabric technology for scale-up connectivity. So, as you continue to drive customer adoption of your overall AI platforms, what's the feedback been like on your AI networking architectures? And any networking-related innovations the team is going to be bringing to the market this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,21,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Harlan, for that question. No question. Networking is an extremely important part of the AI solution, and it's an area that we have been investing and spending quite a bit of effort with our customers and our partners jointly. The way to think about it is that our networking proof points are actually increasing as we are going from MI300 to MI325 to MI350 to MI400. So, in each of those points, we are increasing with a number of proof points. I think people want to see more clusters of ours. Certainly, on inference, we've shown great performance and total cost of ownership.We now also have a number of training systems that we are putting on board. And the important part there is the networking. We have worked very closely with our partners on Ethernet. We believe that this is the right technology for the future. In addition to third-party networking solutions, we are also with our Pensando team developing our own in-house AI NIC that Forrest mentioned at our Q4 advancing AI event. And as we look forward, working with our customers, we are actually standing up full rack solutions at both the MI350 level as well as in the MI400 series. So, I think the net of it is we believe that, yes, it is absolutely very important. And in addition to all of the hardware and software work, the system-level scaling is super important, and we are on track to deliver that with our road map.

Lisa, I just want to follow up the data center GPU business, obviously, very strongly year over year, but it seems for your commentary kind of the sequential growth kind of slows for the next kind of three quarters. So, I just want to understand the why. Obviously, you have some new products coming. So, maybe it's just the shift to the new products. I also want to just ping your brain on in terms of when you look at the ASIC storylines, there tends to be kind of a shift to focus on training versus inference. So, just your perspective, I know a lot of your workloads initially were inference. Are you seeing any shift in terms of the demand from your customers between training inference as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,23,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Blayne. Look, the way I would say it is, we saw tremendous growth as we build up the data center GPU business throughout 2024. So, I think what we're seeing is we are continuing to do new deployments. We're continuing to bring on new customers. Clearly, we are going through a little bit of a product transition time frame in the first half of the year. But the key is bringing in the MI350 series was very, very important for us and for the customer set. So, the fact that that hardware has come on clean. And we've learned a lot from the initial deployments of MI300, I think, is very positive. And this is as we might expect, given the overall landscape of deployments. And then to the second part of your question, as it relates to ASICs, I really haven't seen a big shift at all in the conversation. I will say that the conversation as it relates to AMD, is kind of the following. People like the work that we've done in inference. But certainly, our customers want to see us as a strong training solution. And that's consistent with what we've said, right? We've said that we have like a stepwise road map to really show each one of those solutions. On the software side, we've invested significantly more in some of those sort of the trading libraries. We talked -- Harlan's question earlier about networking. And then this is about just getting into data centers and ramping up tens of thousands of GPUs. So, from my standpoint, I think we are making very good progress there. And I just want to reiterate on the ASIC side, look, I think ASICs are a part of the solution, but there -- I want to remind everyone, they are also a very strong part of the AMD sort of toolbox. So, we've done semi-custom solutions for a long time. We are very involved in a number of ASIC discussions with our customers as well. And what they like to do is, they'd like to take our baseline IP and really innovate on top of that. And that's what I think differentiates our capability is that we do have all of the building blocks of CPUs, GPUs, as well as all of the networking technologies that you would need to put the solutions together.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

I want to ask this a little more explicitly. So, you said your server business was up strong double digits sequentially in Q4. My math suggests that could have even meant that the GPU business was down sequentially. And given your guidance for I guess, flattish GPUs in the first half of '25 versus second half of '24. Again, does the math not suggest that you'd be down sequentially both in Q1 and in Q2 to feel like -- am I doing something wrong with my math?

Perhaps, Stacy, maybe let me help give you a little bit of color there. I don't think we said strong double-digits. I think we said double digits. So, that perhaps is the -- so data center segment was up 9% sequentially. Server was a bit more than that. Data center GPU was a little less than that. I think for some of the models that are out there, you might be a little bit light in the Q3 data center GPU number. So, there might be some adjustments that need to be done there. But I think your suggestion would be incorrect. We -- if you just take the halves, second half '24 to first half '25, let's call it roughly flattish, plus or minus.

Thank you so much for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question on the server CPU business. I'm curious how you're thinking about the market this year. And if you can delineate between cloud and enterprise, that would be really helpful. And then kind of part B to that question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about you all having more than 50% share across the major hyperscalers. How would you characterize the competitive intensity at those customers vis-a-vis some of the internal custom silicon that's expected to ramp over the coming quarters and years?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Toshiya. So, let me say, as we look into 2025, I think we see a good server market between cloud and enterprise. I think as we went into sort of the early part of '24, there was a little bit of, let's call it, less investments on the CPU side as people were optimizing investments for AI. We saw that sort of pick up in the second half of the year in '24, and we would expect that to go into '25. So, the enterprise refresh cycles are coming in again. And certainly, there are a number of cloud vendors that are now, let's call it, reupdating some of their data centers. And then your second question was as it relates to what?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Look, I think it's about the same. What I would say, Toshiya is, it is less about custom silicon versus x86. It is much more about do you have the right product for the right workload. And look, the server market is always a competitive market. What we've done, and you've seen it in our Zen 4 product line as well as in our Zen 5 product line. We've expanded the design points for each of the core generation so that we have cloud-native and then we have enterprise-optimized low core count, high core count, highest performance, best perf per dollar. And I think as we do those things, I think we're continuing to grow share across both cloud and enterprise. And look, it is always very competitive. We take every design win very seriously, but we are winning our fair share. And I think that's the strength of the product portfolio.

And then as a quick follow-up, maybe one for Jean. So, you're guiding gross margin to 54% in the first quarter. I'm curious what some of the major puts and takes are and those are the things that we should be cognizant of going into Q2 and more importantly, the second half. Given your data center commentary skewed more to the second half, I would expect margins to improve in the second half.

Thanks for the question. You are right. Our gross margin is primarily driven by our revenue mix, I think when you look at looking to 2025, Q1 guide, not only data center continued to grow significantly year over year. At the same time, client business is also growing year over year. So, overall, the revenue mix is quite consistent with the Q4. So, the gross margin guide is 54%. I think for the first half, if the revenue mix is at this level, we do feel the gross margin will be consistent with 54%. But going into second half, we do believe the data center is our fastest growth driver for the company and that will drive the gross margin to step up in second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. Lisa, you took up your '24 outlook by $500 million. Curious what drove the change there? And more importantly, as you look forward into calendar '25, I doubt you're going to give us quantitative guidance on this call. But conceptually, how are you thinking about growth in your Instinct between your large cloud customers and your enterprise customers? And if you can speak to the possibility of adding new customers within cloud, again, specific to Instinct, that would be really helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,2,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Toshiya, thank you for the question. So first of all, we had a very strong quarter for the Data Center overall in Q3 and especially for the Instinct product portfolio. We actually completed some important customer milestones, and we were able to ramp a bit above our initial expectations. So Data Center GPU was very strong in the third quarter, and we raised overall guidance for the year from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion based on the completion of some of those customer milestones. So we feel good about the trajectory as we go through the end of this year. And then to your overall question about 2025. At a high level, look, we feel very good about the market from everything that we see, talking to customers, there's significant investment in trying to build out the infrastructure required across all of the AI workloads. And then within that, our product portfolio is getting stronger with the annual cadence, launching 325 later this quarter and 355 in the second half of next year. And then in terms of customers, our customer engagements are actually broadening quite well. So -- and it's broadening in 2 ways. So certainly, cloud -- our largest cloud customers are broadening the set of workloads that they're running on AMD Instinct. And we're also very engaged with a number of large cloud and enterprise customers that are actively working with us and optimizing their workloads, and we would expect those would be good opportunities for us over the next couple of quarters as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then a quick follow-up, maybe one for Jean on gross margin. You're guiding Q4 gross margin essentially flat sequentially, if you can walk through the puts and takes there, that would be really helpful. And then again, as you look forward into '25, you're kind of speaking to continued Data Center growth. One would think the Embedded business hopefully begins to recover. And then within some of your businesses like server CPU, I would expect enterprise to grow perhaps faster off a low base. So I do think you have a lot going for you from a gross margin standpoint. But are those points valid? And what should we be thinking about in terms of potential headwinds as well? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,4,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yes. Thank you for that question. First, we are very pleased with our Q3 gross margin performance. We delivered 53.6% and we are guiding approximately 54% in Q4. In general, when you look at 2024, our gross margin improvement has been primarily driven by the mix, especially Data Center business continue to be the strong growth driver of our business, it's accounting for more than 50% of our revenue mix, that helps us to improve gross margin. Going to 2025, we're not going to guide specifically. But as you mentioned, there are puts and takes that will help us going forward I would say first is, going forward, the largest growth driver is our Data Center business, both the CPU side, the GPU side, and you are absolutely right, we see our Enterprise Server business continue to expand. That will be a tailwind on gross margin side. And secondly, Embedded business is recovering and gradually, but that will also help us with our gross margin. At the same time, we are also seeing our Client business expansion nicely. Client business today is more focused on consumer side, which tend to be below corporate average. That's something headwind we'll deal with. And lastly, I would say our team has done a great job to continue to improve operational efficiency. When we scale the company next year, you can see we're going to benefit from economies of scale to continue to drive our operational efficiency to improve gross margin. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

I guess maybe building on the latter point that you just made, I'm curious of how you would characterize your supply chain having evolved now talking about $5-plus billion. How do we think about what you've been doing on the supply side, given the lead times, the production cycles of these MI300 and MI325 GPUs as we look out into 2025.

So look, I've been very happy with how our supply chain has ramped over the last number of quarters. Clearly, it's a tight supply environment, but we've done a great job getting -- ensuring that we have capacity across the entire supply chain. Again, that was part of the reason for the higher revenue in the third quarter around our Instinct business, just both customer demand as well supply chain improvement. And going into the next few quarters going into 2025, I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we've also planned for significant growth going into 2025. And so we feel good about our overall supply chain capability.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then as a quick follow-up, when I look at the sequential guidance in revenue at the midpoint, let's call it about $680 million up sequentially. Could you help us frame how much of that is driven by Client versus the Data Center piece of the business? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

So certainly, if you look at the sequential guide, the largest contributor is the Data Center business. And that is now such a large piece of our business, it's over 50% of our business in Q3, and it will continue to grow in Q4. Client segment, we also expect to perform well. I think we've done very well with our launches this year, both on the desktop Zen 5 launches as well as the notebook AIPC launches. So we expect growth there. And then the other segments on a sequential basis, Gaming, Embedded would be more modest. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

Jean, when you gave the segment guidance kind of playing off the last question, you didn't mention Embedded as being up. And then, Lisa, you just talked about it being up left. Just curious, I know it's kind of a muted recovery. But what's happening in the Embedded business implied in your fourth quarter guidance? And how are you thinking about 2025 just directionally?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,10,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ross. Let me start, and then maybe Jean can add. Look, we've seen some improvement in the Embedded business. You saw some improvement in the sequential in Q3. We expect some modest improvement in Q4. What we're seeing is really a mix across the different subsegments in Embedded. There are some segments that are stronger. So our test and emulation business actually did very well. We're ramping our new Versal platform there. Aerospace and defense did well, also continues to be relatively strong. Communications has not seen much recovery. So I would say that, that's still fairly muted. And industrial is also a little bit on the softer side. So between all of those, we expect a little bit of growth into Q4, and let's call it, modest growth in 2025, but we're planning for it to be a little bit mixed among the segments, maybe, Jean, if you want to add?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And I guess for my follow-up, just on the EPYC business. You've done incredibly well there, Lisa. Have you seen any kind of loosening up of the crowding out effect with the -- well, in your case, the Instinct side taking demand away from the EPYC side. It doesn't seem to have slowed you down much this year. You're still up by my math, maybe 33% or so. And how are you thinking about that kind of CPU versus GPU dynamic from a customer spend perspective as we look into '25? and I have another quick one.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,13,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure. Let me talk a little bit about the Data Center CPU business. Look, we've been extremely pleased with the progress there. I think the market environment has certainly gotten better over the last couple of quarters. We've seen some of the large cloud customers now sort of adding to their data center capacity and refreshes. We've seen enterprises also start with some of their modernization activities. Within that sort of market environment, our product portfolio has done extremely well. here in the third quarter, the Zen 4 portfolio between Genoa and Bergamo was very strong. We saw the beginning ramp of our Zen 5 Turin capabilities. And then we also actually saw pretty good demand even on Zen 3 or our Milan family just given the performance of price ratios there. So overall, we have a very strong top to bottom stack, and we do see some strength in the overall server market, which adds to some of the AI opportunity that we have. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,14,Ben Reitzes,Melius Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes. If I could stick to the pattern of two. I want to follow up a little bit on servers and thanks for the question. Going to next year, it seems like you're poised for more share gains. And I was just wondering there is a perception that GPUs are cannibalizing the servers. But what are you seeing specifically in Turin? Is it -- with this momentum that you're talking about, is it the right CPU for a GPU are hyperscalers in particular liking the fact you can consolidate and create more room for AI gear. What is the particular catalyst that you're seeing out there with this upgrade?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,15,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ben. So I think when I look at Turin and the environment going into 2025, Turin is actually very well optimized for sort of the broad set of server workloads or traditional CPU workloads, including both scale-up and scale-out workloads. So I think that is very positive. We believe that there will be strong AI content on CPUs, and that helps Turin as well. It's also an important piece of the head node of any GPU configuration. So overall, I think those are all good catalyst for us. And primarily, we're at this point where we're expanding the workloads in general as we are working with our largest cloud customers, and we're making strong progress in enterprise, which has been very important for us. The enterprise sale takes longer. There's a significant amount of POC work and just making sure that CIOs are familiar with our offerings. But I think between our Zen 4, Zen 5 offerings now we really have a very broad portfolio that satisfies the vast majority of the traditional CPU workloads.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then I just want to follow up on the PC market. There's -- just you guys keep outperforming, but there's just general concerns that -- of consumer weakness. And I was just wondering what you're seeing in the 4Q and is there a risk of more than seasonal decline in the 1Q? Or do you feel like things will keep going unabated in the PC market for you guys, particularly?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,17,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, we see a few things in the PC market. So our business tends to be more consumer weighted. So the second half of the year is usually stronger than the first half of the year. And this year, that's added to the fact that we have a couple of product launches. So we launched our desktop products for -- with Zen 5 and our Ryzen 9000 series. And we also launched our AIPC next-generation Ryzen AI 300 products. So I think the combination of those 2 have given us, let's call it, a stronger than normal second half of the year. I would expect there will be seasonality going into the first half. That's typical in our business. I think the main point is, I mean, this is the strongest PC portfolio we've had sort of in our history, I think, across desktop and notebook. And as we go into 2025, I think there's generally some optimism about the PC market, let's call it, maybe growing mid-single digits. And within that, we have the AI PC catalyst as well as some of the Windows 10 sort of end of support coming in 2025 as catalysts. So I think we feel good about the PC market in 2025, but we would expect some level of seasonality going into the first half of the year.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,18,Joshua Buchalter,Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it to 1 since I'm new here. On the Data Center GPU side, I realize everyone wants new customer announcements and 2025 guidance, but we're not going to get that, certainly not today. That maybe you could speak to how much of a runway you think exists at existing customers? And how much of a catalyst MI325X on CDNA3 and then MI355 on the new architecture can be to growing revenue and workload breadth internally and externally at these existing customers as we think about growth into next year at the Data Center GPU side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,19,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Joshua. Thanks for the question. So look, maybe let me start again with this notion of we're very pleased with the progress that we've made in the Data Center GPU business. I mean, if you think about when we started the year, we were just launching MI300. We had talked about perhaps $2 billion of revenue in 2024. And as we've gone through the last few quarters, what we've done is we've successfully completed a number of customer milestones. And those customer milestones include things like ensuring that we are at scale in data centers, meeting all of the reliability requirements and so on and so forth as well as optimizing on specific workloads and ensuring that we have very, very performant -- out-of-the-box performance. So I think we have gained a lot of confidence over the last couple of quarters, just seeing how the customers have ramped I know everyone would like it to go faster. We think it's actually going really well. And being able to talk about exceeding $5 billion of revenue in 2024, I think we feel really good about that. Going into 2025, we feel great about the market. The market continues to be the place where there's a significant capex investments. We feel great about our product portfolio. It is getting stronger with everything that we've learned off of the MI300 ramp. And then in particular, on the software side, we have greatly increased our customer support, customer engagements, out-of-box performance, open source ecosystem, all of those components that are necessary to ensure that customers can run at scale, at performance at a great TCO. So all those together, I think we have a good opportunity to grow at our current customers with the number of workloads. You heard Meta talking at our event about expanding from inference on their large language models with Llama 3.1 to some training workloads. Microsoft has also been a very, very great partner with that. And then you should assume that we are working with all the large customers out there, and many of them are very deep engagements with us to continue to optimize their software to our hardware. So those are the opportunities in front of us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

We actually did better in the Data Center GPU business relative to our initial expectations. So you would imagine that the business was actually greater than $1.5 billion. I mean we're actually seeing now our GPU business really approaching the scale of our CPU business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then just kind of more broadly on the shape of next year. I mean you see that the market with these big customers, how do you see the shape of revenue off of that CQ4 number? Can you continue to grow off that level? Or do you see some risk maybe of a pause next year? And I ask because MI355 is dropping into the existing infrastructure, and I think you did say you'll have a liquid cooled option, but you do hear about some customers wanting rack scale. So I wonder if you worry a bit about there could be a pause before you get to rack scale in 2026.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,24,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I guess I would put it like this. I mean, look, this business is -- there's a lot of activity going on, and we're spending time with customers as they're building out their data centers, some preferred air-cooled environments, liquid cooled environments, some want rack scale, some are perfectly happy to go into their existing data center infrastructure. So there are lots of different variants. What I would say about 2025 is we feel very good about the growth opportunities I would say that it might be lumpy. In general, these are large customer acquisitions and it's not always predictable exactly which quarters you would expect the significant build out. But I think overall, we feel good about the trajectory into 2025. I don't know if that's helpful. Operator The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,25,Joe Moore,Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the $5 billion of AI revenue, how that breaks down between training and inference, if you're able to assess that and just I know you sort of started off with most of the traction in inference, but you've seen some traction on the training side. Can you just talk about what that split looks like going forward as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,26,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Joe. So certainly, from the $5 billion that we're talking about, the early traction has been primarily with inference just given the strength of the product portfolio. MI300 is like very, very well optimized for inference given the memory capacity and memory bandwidth capabilities. But we have had some training adoption, and we expect that, that will continue to grow as we go through the next few quarters. And so as we -- let's call it fast forward a year, I would say we would have a fairly balanced portfolio between training and inference.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,27,Vivek Arya,Analyst,analyst,"-- I had two. So Lisa, for the first one, how do you address this investor argument that MI is off to a great start, but spec-wise, remains kind of 1 year behind the industry leader, right? You're shipping something comparable to Hopper while they are starting to ship Blackwell next year. When you are at MI350, they will be on Blackwell Ultra or Rubin. So how do you see AMD closing that gap? And can you really gain share until that gap is closed?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,28,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Vivek, I actually don't see that. So maybe let me state it in another way. I think MI300, when we launched it was behind H100, H100 was in the market for a much longer time. And we have with our accelerated road map actually closed a good part of that gap. I think MI325 is a great product. It's going to compete very well with H200 and the MI350 series will compete very well with Blackwell. In the overarching view of the world, frankly, the market continues to be constrained, particularly in the newer product generations. It takes a long time to go from, let's call it, shipping your first samples to actually ramping in volume production workloads. And I think one of the advantages that we have with the -- with our portfolio is that from a data center retrofit standpoint, it's actually a much easier ramp, just the infrastructure is the same. So look, there are lots of opportunities across the set of AI workloads. We think this road map is actually strengthening over time, and that's the feedback that we're getting from our customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,29,Vivek Arya,Analyst,analyst,"-- And for my follow-up, Lisa, back to the question on the PC market. So it was up -- or the client was up 26% sequentially. I think you are guiding to some growth in Q4 as well. How do you see the state of the channel? And I ask that just because sell-through in Q3 was not that great. And I think Intel had guided down their Q3 to be flat or down. So just how much of the growth that you are seeing is because of ASPs? How much of this is units? And as you look out to 2025, do you think the ASP strength that we have seen this year, can that mix benefit continue for you in '25 also?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,30,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Vivek, the way I would say it is our client business has a few factors that may be slightly different from the overall market. So let me start with our desktop channel. I think our share is very high in the desktop channel. And we've done very well there. So we saw strength across that portfolio in Q3. We actually saw some of our highest sell-through, so it was a strong sell-through quarter. And obviously, it shows in the revenue results. . I think on the notebook standpoint, our business tends to be more heavily consumer weighted and so that is more of a second half story. There is good momentum around AI PCs. I mean we've looked at some of the activation rates of our newest risen AI 300 processors and the activation rates are good. It's still very early in the AI PC cycle, but we are seeing some good momentum there. So I think we'll see both units up and the ASPs will depend a little bit on the mix between consumer and enterprise and desktop and notebooks. But my earlier comment about the Client segment, I think it is an opportunity for us. We are underrepresented in the Client segment. And we see an opportunity to grow both in consumer as well as enterprise. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,31,Harlan Sur,Analyst,analyst,"-- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, on your core EPYC business, you did start to see recovery in enterprise last quarter. It was broad-based across many verticals. You've got -- you've also got a growing share dynamic as well, right? And it sounds like that trend continued in the September quarter. Do you anticipate continued follow-through in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth this quarter for enterprise? And then maybe what sort of enterprise and general cloud demand trends are you seeing out of China?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,32,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Harlan, thanks for the question. We did see positive growth momentum here in the third quarter in enterprise. We are getting broader adoption and we're seeing that growth both in on-prem deployments as well as cloud third-party deployments. And so we're very happy with sort of the adoption of our cloud instances when people are doing migrations, they're migrating from on-prem to cloud, they're migrating to AMD or they're migrating from older cloud instances to newer cloud instances. We're seeing migrations to AMD. So I think that helps us in both the Enterprise segment as well as the Cloud segment. As we go forward into the fourth quarter, I think we are expecting another quarter of growth on a sequential basis for our Server business and strength in both Enterprise and Cloud. And I think as we think about our opportunities going forward, the Enterprise business is a place where we have been underrepresented. I think our portfolio has strengthened. So the platforms that are being offered by the OEMs have broadened with not just Zen 4, but also with the Zen 5 portfolio launch. And so I think those are opportunities for us in 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question. But the first one, I wanted to go back to what you said about the size of the Data Center GPUs in the quarter. You said it was approaching the size of Your compute business which you put around what under $1.7 billion, maybe a little more. Is that right? And like if that is right, it implies that at $5 billion for the year, you'd actually be down in Q4. So I'd probably got to be $5.2 billion or $5.3 billion for the full year, just to be flat sequentially and more than that to get growth. So I guess the question is number one, is that the size of the business that you're talking about in Q3? And is that the kind of level of growth you're thinking into Q4?

You have to remember that in our Data Center segment, we have some other revenue that is not CPUs and GPUs, right? We have some FPGAs and other things. But the question earlier was the revenue of $1.5 billion, and I said that it was greater than $1.5 billion. So take that as a fundamental. And then as -- we talked about -- we didn't guide an exact number for the data center GPU. We said exceed $5 billion.

For my follow-up, you talked a little bit about lumpiness next year, is there any kind of seasonality or something that I to be thinking about specifically into Q1 for Data Center GPU? I know you have like the MI300, I guess, ramping into production at that point. But should I be thinking about a seasonal -- like seasonality into Q1 given the general statement on lumpiness?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,37,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I wasn't implying something about seasonality of the Data Center GPU business. I was implying more that if you think about the evolution of the business, it depends quite a bit on a specific number of customers. So these are large customers that drive deployments. Like for example, the third quarter was a bit higher than we expected. That was driven by some additional customer demand, and we may see that type of lumpiness. So that was what I was implying. And we'll have to see how things evolve as we get into 2025. Operator We have time for two more questions. The next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,38,Harsh Kumar,Analyst,analyst,"-- Lisa, first of all, congratulations on your 10-year anniversary. I just looked at the 10-year chart, the stock is around $3, so a heck of a job here. And also congratulations on $5 billion in Instinct revenues. So I wanted to ask the first question. This is one we get from investors all the time. In the coming year, let's say, 2025, your key competitor will take most of the TAM of the AI market, the GPU market, rough count, they'll take in something like $50 billion, $60 billion, you'll get another $5 billion to $10 billion, call it. So the question is, what do you think is the major hindrance? You've got chip level compatibility. So does it boil down to the fact that you're just earlier in the game. You've been doing this just 12 months in a serious manner? Or is there still a rack level of disparity? If you could just help us think about what the hindrances are to you becoming a major player here.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,39,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Harsh. Thanks for the question and for the comments. Maybe let me say, I view them as opportunities. If you remember, Harsh, and I think you do, our EPYC ramp from Zen 1, Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4 we had extremely good product even back in the Rome days, but it does take time to ensure that there is trust built, there is familiarity with the product set. There are some differences, although we're both GPUs, there are some differences, obviously, in the software environment. And people want to get comfortable with the workload ramp. So from a ramp standpoint, I'm actually very positive on the ramp rate. It's the fastest product ramp that I've seen overall. And my view is this is a multi-generational journey. We've always said that. We feel very good about the progress I think next year is going to be about expanding both customer set as well as workload. And as we get into the MI400 series, we think it's an exceptional product. So -- all in all, the ramp is going well, and we will continue to earn and -- earn the trust and the partnership of these large customers. What I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD. And we see that everywhere we go, everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that's what we intend to do.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, from a follow-up, and maybe Jean can help out here. It's kind of well understood that your gross margin for MI300, MI325 will be below corporate margins. Could you help us maybe think of some framework on how those gross margins for Instinct might get to parity with your corporate business?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,41,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yes. We are very pleased with our overall revenue ramp of our Data Center GPU business, and our team not only support the revenue ramp and continue to improve the gross margin. Overall, it's below corporate average. And when you think about it going into next year, of course, our top priority right now is to really focus on to address customer demand and provide the TCO benefit really increase significantly our market presence and drive substantial revenue growth. On the gross margin side, once we continue to ramp the revenue, we do think we'll have the opportunity to continue to improve gross margin. When you think about it, this is the data center business, over the -- in the longer run, longer term, it tends to be better than corporate average. We'll take some time to get there. But when you look at our Data Center segment performance, we more than doubled the revenue year-over-year, but we tripled the operating income year-over-year. So I think that's how we are thinking about it is really to drive the long-term growth and get the market presence at the same time, drive gross margin up.

Lisa, I just wanted to ask on mix the MI300 platform into Q4. Obviously, you're launching the MI325 series. Should you say -- should we expect a significant contribution the new product in Q4? Or is this a situation in which it's launching late year and most of the impact is into Q1? I guess that's the first one. And then the second one is just if you look into next year, could you talk about where the end markets are and Embedded for Xilinx? You gave some color on comm and a little of industrial there. But just where we're at in terms of starting kind of Q4 and into Q1. Are there any that are outperforming, underperforming?

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Absolutely, Tom. So back to your first question in terms of the mix in Q4. We would expect the majority of the mix will still be on MI300. MI325 is going into production late in the quarter, and it will be more of a first quarter ramp. So that's that question. And then in terms of the Embedded business going to 2025, I would say that the trends that we see are similar to what I mentioned for the Q3, Q4 timing. We do expect that we're -- some of the markets will recover, we're expecting that it will be a gradual recovery. So we see that. And the strength that we see is in some of the Test and Emulation segment, we see some strength, certainly in aerospace and defense. There was a little bit of recovery in automotive that we started to see. We're still waiting for comms and industrial. So we'll get more visibility on that as we go through sort of the end of this year, but that's what we see currently.

Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So, I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially. And if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly, given your road map for next year.

Thanks for the question. So, first of all, on sort of MI300 and the customer evolution, we're very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production, and then see what the production capabilities are, especially performance and all of those things. And I can say now being sort of more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers, as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we're working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff. So, I would say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. As we go into next year, I mean, one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our road map. I think we feel really good about our road map. We're on track to launch MI325 later this year, and then next year, our MI350 Series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well. So, I think, overall, we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we're continuing to expand that pipeline.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

I guess sticking on the data center side, as we look forward and you think about the full year, I'm curious of how you're currently thinking about the EPYC server CPU growth expectations as we go forward.

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So, you know, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things. First of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our fourth-gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well. So, I think overall, I think our EPYC portfolio has done well. Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. We see -- first of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both enterprise and cloud. And so, I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So, we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well. So, overall, I think the server market and our ability to continue to grow share in the server market is one of the things that we see in the second half of the year.

Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we're seeing a big rack scale or shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product. And I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling and is it going to have a rack scale aspect to it? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,7,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You'll see us invest more in system-level integration. But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so, it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So, we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,9,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Ross. So, first, you know, we're very pleased with our client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map. The Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in this -- in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So, we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities. So, overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong. And we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to maybe draw a parallel between the Instinct portfolio that your company is rolling out now and what you guys did five or six years ago with EPYC. And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I would say, reaction positively and negatively and sort of sentiment around where your road map might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were. Super early, but if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side with your customers two, three, four generations forward. So, is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300? And maybe you could talk about the level of engagement, the intensity of engagement, the breadth of it across the customer base with 350 and 400. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Matt. So, look, as I said earlier, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the Instinct road map. This is absolutely a long-term play so absolutely, you're correct. It has a lot of parallels to the EPYC journey, where you really have to -- you gain more opportunities, broader workloads, larger deployments as you go from generation to generation. So, we are playing the long game here. Our conversations with our customers, so I would start with first, in the near term, we had some very key milestones that we wanted to pass this year. And as I said, they related to getting hardware in volume in multiple hyperscalers as well as large Tier 2 customers. We've done that. We've now seen our software in a lot of different environments, and it's matured substantially. ROCm is in very, from a standpoint of features, functions, out-of-box performance, getting to performance with customers, we've gained a lot of confidence and learned a lot in that whole process. The networking aspects of building out the rack scale and the system-level items are areas that we're continuing to invest in. And then the point of having long-term conversations across multiple generations is also really important. So, I think all of those things have progressed well. We view this as very good progress for MI300, but we have a lot more to do. And I think the various road maps will help us open up those opportunities over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, there seems to be this ongoing industry debate about AI monetization and whether your customers are getting the right ROI on their capex. And today, they have these three options, right? They can buy GPUs from your largest competitor with all the software bells and whistles and incumbency, or they can do custom chips, or they can buy from AMD. So, how do you think this plays out next year? Do you think your customers, given all this concern around monetization, does it make them consolidate their capex around just the other two suppliers? How is your visibility going into next year, given this industry debate? And how will AMD continue to kind of carve a position between these two other competitive choices that are out there? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think the overall view on AI investment is we have to invest. I mean, the industry has to invest. The potential of AI is so large to impact the way enterprises operate and all that stuff. So, I think the investment cycle will continue to be strong. And then relative to the various choices for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions, whether you're talking about GPUs or you're talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions. In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong road map and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice. So, I think the opportunity is very large. And I think our piece of that is really strong technology with strong partnerships with the key AI market makers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question, Joe. So, as we said on MI300, there are lots of great characteristics about it. One of it -- one of them is our memory bandwidth and memory capacity is leading the industry. From that standpoint, the early deployments have largely been inference in most cases, and we've seen fantastic performance from an inference standpoint. We also have customers that are doing training. We've also seen that from a training standpoint, we've optimized quite a bit our ROCm software stack to make it easier for people to train on AMD. And I do expect that we'll continue to ramp training over time. As we go forward, I think you'll see -- the belief is that inference will be larger than training from a market standpoint. But from an AMD standpoint, I would expect both inference and training to be growth opportunities for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Curious if you could provide an update there. And then my Part B to my question is on profitability for MI300. I think in the past, you've talked about the business being accretive and improving further over time as you sort of work through the kinks, if you will.

Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, on the supply side, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe I'll let Jean comment on sort of the trajectory for the business. So, on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So, under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so, we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities, and really that's accelerating our customer adoption overall, and we'll see how things play out as we go into the second half of this year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So, we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average. From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our data center platform, especially both the server and the data center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge.

I wanted to dig into the Q3 guidance a little bit if I could. So, with gaming down double digits, it probably means you've got close to $1 billion of growth revenue across data center, client, and embedded. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how that $1 billion-ish splits out across those three businesses.

So, Harsh, overall, maybe if I take a step back and just talk about how the systems are evolving, there's no question that the systems are getting more complex, especially as you go into large training clusters, and our customers need help to put those together. And that includes the sort of Infinity Fabric-type solutions that are the basis for the UALink things as well as just general rack-level system integration. I think what you should expect, Harsh is, first of all, we're very pleased with all of the partners that have come together for UALink. We think that's an important capability. But we have all of the pieces of this already within sort of the AMD umbrella with our Infinity Fabric, with the work with our networking capability through the acquisition of Pensando.

Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask another question on MI300. Just curious if you can kind of characterize the makeup of the customers in the first half. I know you had, end of last year, a government customer. Is there still a government contingency? And kind of the second part of it is really you've invested in all these software assets. Kind of curious the challenge of ramping the next wave of customers. I know there's been a lot of talk on some hardware challenges, memory issues, and such, but then you're investing in software. I'm sure that's a big challenge, too. Just kind of curious what the biggest hurdle is for you to kind of get that next wave of customers ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,36,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, Blayne, a lot of pieces to that question so let me try to address them. First, on your question about, I think you're basically asking about the supercomputing piece. That was mainly Q4 and a bit in Q1. So, if you think about our Q2 revenue, think about it as almost all AI. So, it's MI300X, it's for large AI, hyperscalers as well as OEM customers going to enterprise and Tier 2 data centers. So, that's the makeup of the customer set. And then in terms of the various pieces of what we're doing, I think first on your question about memory, I think there's a lot of noise in the system. I wouldn't really pay attention to all that noise in the system. I mean, this has been an incredible ramp. And I'm actually really proud of what the team has done in terms of just definitely fastest product ramp that we've ever done to $1 billion here in the -- over $1 billion in the second quarter and then ramping each quarter in Q3 and Q4. In terms of memory, we have multiple suppliers that we've qualified on HBM3. And it's a tricky -- memory is a tricky business, but I think we've done it very well and that's there. And then we're also qualifying HBM3E for future products with multiple memory suppliers as well. So, to your overarching question of what are the things that we're doing, the exciting part of this is that the ROCm capability has really gotten substantially better because so many customers have been using it. And with that, what we look at is out-of-box performance, how long does it take a customer to get up and running on MI300? And we've seen, depending on the software that companies are using, particularly if you're based on some of the higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, etc., we can be out-of-the-box running very well in a very short amount of time, like, let's call it, very small number of weeks. And that's great because that's expanding the overall portfolio. We are going to continue to invest in software, and that was one of the reasons that we did the Silo AI acquisition. It's a great acquisition for us. 300 scientists and engineers. These are engineers that have experience with AMD hardware and are very, very good at helping customers get up and running on AMD hardware. And that's -- so we view this as the opportunity to expand the customer base with talent like Silo AI, like Nod.ai which brought a lot of compiler talent. And then we continue to hire quite a bit organically. So, I think Jean said earlier that we see leverage in the model, but we're going to continue to invest because this opportunity is huge, and we have all of the pieces. This is just about building out scale.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question. I'll give you a breather from the MI300 for a second, but just to focus on client in the second half. No problem. Focused on client in the second half, you kind of said above seasonal for September, December. You're obviously launching a new notebook, desktop product, but you're also talking about AI PC. Could you just break down where you're seeing those above-seasonal trends? Is it the ASP uplift you're getting from the new products? Is it a unit assumption that's coming with AI PC? Just any kind of breakdown between those two and why you're seeing it a little bit better. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,40,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Tom. So, I think you actually said it well. We are launching Zen 5 desktops and notebooks with volume ramping in the third quarter. And that's the primary reason that we see above seasonal. The AI PC element is certainly one element of that, but there is just the overall refresh. Usually, desktop launches going into a third quarter are good for us, and we feel that the products are very well-positioned. So, those are the primary reasons. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,41,Christopher Danely,Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, gang, thanks for sneaking me in. Just a question on gross margin. So, if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,42,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. I think, first, we have made a lot of progress, as you mentioned, this year to expand our gross margin from 2023 at a 50 percentage point to -- you know, we actually guided 53.5% for Q3. The primary driver is really the faster data center business growth. If you look at the data center business as a percentage of revenue from 37% in Q4 last year to now close to 50%. That faster expansion really helped us with the gross margin. When you look at the second half, we'll continue to see data center to be the major driver of our top-line revenue growth, will help with the margin expansion. But there are some other puts and takes. I think Lisa mentioned the PC business actually is going to do better in second half, especially typically, seasonally, it tends to be more consumer-focused. So, that really is a little bit different dynamics there. Secondly, I would say embedded business, we are going to see embedded business to be up sequentially each quarter. But the recovery, as we mentioned earlier, is more gradual. So, when you look at the balance of the picture, that's why we see the gross margin -- the pace of the gross margin changed a little bit, but we do see continued gross margin expansion. As far as MI300, we are quite confident over the long term, it will be accretive to our corporate average. We feel pretty good about the overall data center business to continue to be absolutely the driver of gross margin expansion.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,1,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, my first question is on the MI300. You're taking up the full-year outlook from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. I'm curious, what's driving that incremental $500 million in revenue? Is it new customers? Is it additional bookings from existing customers? Is it more cloud? Is it more enterprise? If you can sort of provide color there that would be helpful. And then on the supply side, there's been headlines or chatter that CoWos under HBM could be a pretty severe constraining factor for you guys. If you can speak to how you're handling the supply side of the equation, that would be helpful, too. And then I have a quick follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Great. Thank you, Toshiya for the question. Look, the MI300 ramp is going really well. If we look at just what's happened over the last 90 days, we've been working very closely with our customers to qualify MI300 in their production data centers, both from a hardware standpoint, software standpoint. So far, things are going quite well, and what we see now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new customers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And I view this as you know very much -- as a very dynamic market, and there are lots of customers. We said on the -- in the prepared remarks that we have over 100 customers that were engaged with in both development as well as deployment. So overall the ramp is going really well. As it relates to the supply chain, actually I would say I'm very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is absolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It's a very complex product. Chiplets, CoWos, 3D integration, HBM. And so far it's gone extremely well. We've gotten great support from our partners. And I would say even in the quarter that we just finished, we actually did a little bit better than expected when we first started the quarter. I think Q2 will be another significant ramp, and we're going to ramp supply every quarter this year. So I think the supply chain is going well. We are tight on supply. So there's no question in the near term that if we had more supply we have demand uh for that product. And we're going to continue to work on those elements as we go through the year. But I think both on the demand side and the supply side, I'm very pleased with how the ramp is going.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, I was hoping you could speak to your data center GPU roadmap beyond the MI300. The other concern that we hear is your nearest competitor has been pretty transparent with their roadmap, and that extends into '25 and oftentimes '26. So maybe this isn't the right venue for you to give too much. But beyond the MI300, how should we think about your roadmap and your ability to compete in data center? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So look, Toshiya, when we start with the roadmap, I mean we always think about it as a multi-year, multi-generational roadmap. So we have the follow-ons to MI300 as well as the next next generations well in development. I think what is true is we're getting much closer to our top AI customers. They're actually giving us significant feedback on the roadmap and what we need to meet their needs. Our chiplet architecture is actually very flexible, and so that allows us to actually make changes to the roadmap as necessary. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to be very competitive. Frankly, I think we're going to get more competitive. Right now, I think MI300X is in a sweet spot for inference, very, very strong inference performance. I see as we bring in additional products later this year into 2025, that will continue to be a strong spot for us, and then we're also enhancing our training performance and our software roadmap to go along with it. So more details to come in the coming months. But we have a strong roadmap that goes through the next couple of years, and it is informed by just a lot of learning in working with our top customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,7,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, Thanks for having me ask a question. The non AI side of the data center business, it sounds like the enterprise side has some good traction even though the sequential drop happened seasonally, Lisa. But I was just wondering, what's implied in your second-quarter guidance for the data center CPU side of things? And generally speaking, how are you seeing that whole kind of GPU versus CPU crowding out dynamic playing out for the rest of 2024?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. Ross, thanks for the question. I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed. I think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter actually some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of Genoa is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise. In the second quarter, we expect overall data center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business, but we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year. That will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the client side, I noted you guided it up sequentially. Any sort of magnitudes around that for the second quarter? And perhaps more importantly, when you talk about the whole AI PC side of things, do you believe that's more of a unit driver for you, an ASP driver? Or will it be both?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,10,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, so I think, again I think we're pretty excited about the AI PC, both opportunity in, let's call it, the near term and even more so in the medium term. I think the client business is performing well, both on the channel and on the M&C side. We expect client to be up sequentially in the second quarter. And as we go into the second half of the year, to your question about units versus ASPs, I think we expect some increase in units as well as ASPs. The AI PC products, when we look at the Strix products, it's -- they're really well suited for the premium segments of the market. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the AI PC content strongest in the beginning. And then as we go into 2025, you would see it more across the rest of the portfolio.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,13,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Lisa, I have sort of a longer-term question and then a shorter-term follow-up. One, I guess is the -- one of the questions that I've been getting from folks a lot is, obviously your primary competitor has announced, I guess, a multiyear roadmap. And we continue to hear more and more from other folks about internal ASIC programs at some of your primary customers, whether they be for inference, or training, or both. I guess it would be really helpful if you could to talk to us about how your conversations go with those customers, how committed they are to your long-term roadmap, multi-generation, as you described it, how they juxtapose doing investments of their internal silicon versus using a merchant supplier like yourselves and maybe what advantages the experience across a large footprint of customers can give your company that those guys doing internal ASICs might not get. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think one of the things that we see and we've said is that the TAM for AI compute is growing extremely quickly, and we see that continuing to be the case in all conversations. We had highlighted a TAM of, let's call it, $400 billion in 2027. I think some people thought that was aggressive at the time. But the overall AI compute needs, as we talk to customers, is very, very strong. And you've seen that in some of the announcements, even recently with some of the largest cloud guys. From my view, there are several aspects of it. First of all, we have great relationships with all of sort of the top AI companies. And the idea there is we want to innovate together. When you look at these large language models and everything that you need for training and inferencing there, although there will be many solutions, I don't think there's just one solution that will fit all. The GPU is still the preferred architecture, especially as the algorithms and the models are continuing to evolve over time, and that favors our architecture and also our ability to really optimize CPU with GPU. So from my standpoint, I think we're very happy with the partnerships that we have. I think this is a huge opportunity for all of us to really innovate together, and we see that there's a very strong commitment to working together over multiple years going forward. And that's, I think, a testament to some of the work that we've done in the past, and that very much is what happened with the epic roadmap as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,15,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Appreciate that, Lisa. As my follow-up, a little bit shorter term. And I guess having followed the company super closely for a long time, I think there's been -- there's always been noise in the system from whether the stock price is $2 a share or $200. There's been kind of always consistent noise one way or the other. But the last 1.5 months has been extreme in that sense. And so I wanted to just -- I've got random reports in my inbox about changes in demand from some of your MI300 customers or planned demand for consuming your product. I think you answered earlier about the supply situation and how you're working with your partners there. But has there been any change from the customers that you're in ramp with now or that you soon will be of what their intention is for demand? Or in fact has that maybe strengthened rather than gone down in recent periods? Because I keep getting questions about it. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,16,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Matt. Look, I think I might have said it earlier, but maybe I'll repeat it again. I think the demand side is actually really strong. And what we see with our customers and what we are tracking very closely is customers moving from, let's call, it initial POCs to pilots, to full scale production, to deployment across multiple workloads. And we're moving through that sequence very well. I feel very good about the deployments and ramps that we have ongoing right now, and I also feel very good about new customers who are sort of earlier on in that process. So from a demand standpoint, we continue to build backlog as well as build engagements going forward. And similarly on the supply standpoint, we're continuing to build supply momentum. But from a speed-of-ramp standpoint, I'm actually really pleased with the progress.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

We also see AI head nodes, as another place where we see growth in, let's call it, the more traditional market. Our sweet spot is really in the highest performance, sort of high core count, energy efficiency space, and that is playing out well. And we're also -- we've traditionally been very strong in, let's call it, cloud first-party workloads. And that is now extending to cloud third-party workloads where we see enterprises who are, let's call it, in more of a hybrid environment adopting AMD both in the cloud and on-prem.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,24,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I just wanted to go back to the supply question and the $4 billion outlook for this year. I think at some point, there was a suggestion that the $4 billion number, right, that there are still supply constraints. But I think at a different point, you said that you have supply visibility significantly beyond that. Given that we are almost at the middle of the year, I would have thought that you would have much better visibility about the back half. So is the $4 billion number a supply constraint number? Or is it a demand constraint number? Or alternatively, if you could give us some sense of what the exit rate of your GPU sales could be. I think on the last call, $1.5 billion was suggested. Could it be a lot more than that in terms of your exit rate of MI for this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,25,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Vivek. Let me try to make sure that we answer this question clearly. From a full-year standpoint, our $4 billion number is not supply capped. I'm sorry, yes, it's not supply capped. It is -- we do have supply capability above that. It is more back half-weighted. So if you're looking at sort of the near term, the near term, I would say for example in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply. By the way, I think this is an overall industry issue. This is not at all related to AMD. I think overall, AI demand has exceeded anyone's expectations in 2024. So you've heard it from the memory guys. You've heard it from the foundry guys. We're all ramping capacity as we go through the year. And as it relates to visibility, we do have good visibility into what's happening. As I said, we have great customer engagements that are going forward. My goal is to make sure that we pass all of the milestones as we're ramping products. And as we pass those milestones, we put that into the um, the overall full-year guidance for AI. But in terms of how customer progression things are going, they're actually going quite well. And we continue to bring new customers on, and we continue to expand workloads with our current customers. And so hopefully, that clarifies the question, Vivek.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thank you, Lisa. Maybe one nod on MI, but maybe on the embedded business. I think you sound a bit more measured about Q2 and the second half rebound, which is similar to what we have heard from a lot of the auto industrial peers. But where are you in the inventory clearing cycle? And if embedded has a somewhat more measured rebound in the back half, what implication does that have on gross margin expansion? Can we continue to expect, I don't know, 100 basis points a quarter in terms of gross margin expansion because of the data center mix? Or just any puts and takes of embedded, and then what it means for gross margins in the back half. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thank you for the question. I think the embedded business declined a little bit more than expected really due to the weaker demand in some of the markets. Very specifically, communication has been weak. And some pockets of industrial and automotive, as you mentioned, it's actually quite consistent with the peers. Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of embedded business, and we'll start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question is when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and guided Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the data center side. The data center will continue to ramp in second half. I think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in second half. Of course, if embedded is doing better, we'll have a more tailwind in second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

I also wanted to ask about your data center GPU roadmap. The customers that we talk to say that they're engaged, not just because of MI300 but really because of what's coming, and it seems like there's a big demand shift to rack scale systems that try to optimize performance per square foot given some of the data center and power constraints. So can you just talk about how important systems are going to be in your roadmap And do you have all the pieces you need as the market shifts to rack scale systems?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Timothy, thanks for the question. For sure, look, our customers are engaged in the multi-generational conversations. So we've -- definitely going out over the next couple of years. And as it relates to the overall system integration, it is quite important. It is something that we're working very closely with our customers and partners on. That's a significant investment in networking, working with a number of networking partners as well to make sure that the scale-out capability is there. And to your question of do we have the pieces, we do absolutely have the pieces. I think the work that we've always done with our Infinity Fabric as well as with our Pensando acquisition, that's brought in a lot of networking expertise. And then we're working across the networking ecosystem with key partners like Broadcom, and Cisco, and Arista who are with us at our AI data center event in December. So our work right now in future generations is not just specifying a GPU. It is specifying, let's call it, full system reference designs, and that's something that will be quite important going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then just as a quick follow up, I know you know this year looks like it's going to be pretty back half loaded in your server CPU business just like it was last year. And I know you kind of held our hands at about this time last year, sort of on what the full year could look like and how back end loaded it could be. So I kind of wonder could you give us some milestones in terms of how much server CPU could grow this year, how back end loaded. It could be is it is like up 30% this year for your server CPU business year over year. Is that a reasonable bogey?

Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I wanted to address the MI300 ramp into Q2. So you said you've done $1 billion give or take in cumulative sales, which puts it at maybe, I don't know, maybe $600 million in Q1. You're guiding total revenues up about $225 million into Q2. But you've got client up. You've got traditional data center up. You've got embedded flat. Gaming is going to be down, but I'd hazard a guess that the client and traditional data center like offset it, if not more.

It's -- if you look at the gaming, the demand has been quite weak. That's quite very well known, and also their inventory level. So based on the visibility we have, the first half, both Q1 and Q2, we guided down sequentially more than 30%. We actually think the second half will be lower than first half. That's basically how we're looking at this year for the gaming business. And at the same time, gaming's gross margin is lower than our company average.

I think you're right, is the GPU gross margin right now is below the data center gross margin level. I think there are two reasons. Actually, the major reason is that we actually increase the investment quite significantly to -- as Lisa mentioned, to expand and accelerating our roadmap in the AI side. That's one of the major drivers of the operating income coming down slightly.

Thanks for taking my question. On your data center GPU segment and the faster time to production shipments, given you just upped your full-year GPU outlook, how much of it is faster bring up of your customers frameworks driven by your latest ROCm software platform and maybe stronger collaboration with your customers engineers just to get them to call faster?

What it really is is both us and our customers feeling confident in broadening the ramp. Because if you think about it, first of all, the ROCm stack has done really well. And the work that we're doing is hand in hand with our customers to optimize their key models. And it was important to get sort of verification and validation that everything would run well, and we've now passed some important milestones in that area. And then I think the other thing is, as you said, there's a huge demand for more AI compute and so our ability to participate in that, and help customers get that up and running is great. So I think overall as we look at it, this ramp has been very, very aggressive if you think about where we were just a quarter ago. Each of these are pretty complex bring-ups, and I'm very happy with how they've gone.

Just going back, just kind of rewinding back to the March quarter. So similar to the PC client business, right, which declined at the low end of the seasonal range, if I make certain assumptions around your data center GPU business, I expect that out of data center, it looks like your server CPU business was also down at the lower end of the seasonal range. By my math, it was down like 5%, 6% sequentially. Is that right? And that's less than half the decline of your competitor. And if so, like what drove the less than seasonal declines?

Lisa, I had two. One is for you and one perhaps for Jean. So we recently hosted a very large custom GPU company for a call, and they talked about kind of mega data centers coming up in the near to mid-term, talking about nodes potentially in the 100,000-plus range and maybe up to a million. So as we look out at these kinds of data centers, from an architectural standpoint, is that a situation where winner takes all where if somebody gets in, they kind of get all the sockets? Or will they be lines where your chip perhaps or your board can be placed right next to somebody else's board maybe on a separate line? Just help us understand how something like that would play out if there's a chance for more than one competitor to play in such a large data center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think as we look at sort of how AI shapes up over the next few years, there are customers who would be looking at very large training environments. And perhaps, that's what you're talking about. I think our view of that is number one, we view that as a very attractive area for AMD. It's an area where, we believe we have the technology to be very competitive there. And I think the desire would be to have optionality in terms of how you build those out. So obviously a lot has to happen between here and there.

Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of framing the outlook and the guidance for this calendar first quarter. I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis the $400 million of Data Center GPU revenue that you expected in Q4. What did that ultimately kind of fell off to be? And then, on the guidance into 1Q, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as, as we think about the server business into the 1Q guide?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Aaron. Let me start and then see if Jean has something to add. So, relative to the Data Center GPU business, we were very pleased with performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product and we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramped very well. And then, we saw MI300X. The AI product actually exceed our expectations based on strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went and then the ramp -- manufacturing ramp. So, we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter. And then, going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it, something around, let's call it, high-single-digit, low-double-digit. There are also some other pieces of the Data Center business. I think, the key piece of it is we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X and what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well, and the customer demand is strong. And so, we will see MI300X increase as we go into the first quarter, and things are going relatively well so.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, Client is very similar to server, typically Q1 is high-single-digit to low-double-digit. That's consistent with past. On the Embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and the consistent with what you see in the industry's Embedded business is going through a bottoming process, and we think Q1, it will have a low-double-digit sequential decline. That's Embedded. On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during his -- her prepared remarks is we have the latest stage of product cycle in the year five of gaming console. But at the same time, we also have inventory at the customers. So, the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 Gaming sequential declines probably more than 30%, so hopefully that help you a little bit.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Very helpful, Jean. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious. The traditional server demand that you see, I know when we looked at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year over year. Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it, non-AI general-purpose server market as we move through '24?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,5,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Aaron. So look, I think, I agree with your characterization of the 2023 demand, although we did see some strong progress in the second half of the year, especially as customers in Cloud and Enterprise adopted our Genoa and our Zen 4 family. So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious. That being the case though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business. I think our portfolio is extremely strong. The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as our new Siena product lines are getting a lot of traction. And then, we also see Turin, our Zen 5 product coming in the second half of the year. So, even in a mixed demand environment, I think we're bullish on what traditional server CPUs can do in 2024. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Lisa, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of the milepost that you're kind of marching toward on this $400 billion TAM that you have for 2027. For example, do you think you can gain share at a rate that's kind of similar to the rate that you gained share for server CPU or I guess maybe asked a different way, is it reasonable to kind of look at your consumer GPU share of 20 plus percent, is that a reasonable bogey, or do you have aspirations higher than that, perhaps?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks, Tim, for the question. I would say a couple of things. First of all, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in our Data Center GPU business. I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months, I think has been great. And that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business. I think the beauty of the AI market here is, it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic, as well as our ability to gain share in that framework. The point I will make is our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multi-generational conversations. So, as excited as we are about the ramp of MI300 and, frankly, there's a lot to do in 2024. We are also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that '25, '26, '27 timeframe. So, I think, we see a lot of growth. I think it's a little early to make market share projections, but I would say it's a significant growth driver given the market demand, as well as our own product capabilities.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Jean, I guess as a follow-up. I know that you don't want to guide the full year. But I'm wondering if I can pin you down just to touch on maybe a milepost that you're kind of marching to for 2024 growth is up 20% for the whole company. Is that a reasonable target? And then, I guess within Data Center, if you just add the incremental Data Center GPU revenue and you assume that the server business grows a little bit, it seems like that should maybe double year over year, but I'm kind of wondering if you can give us any ranges on those numbers?

Thank you for the question. Yeah, we're not guiding a year. It's very early of the year, literally, January. I think the way to think about it is, Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks we feel pretty good about both our Data Center and the Client business to grow in 2024. Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center between both the server side gaining more share, and Data Center GPU side with the significant ramp up of our MI300. I think that's how we think about it. We do have a headwind from Gaming segment. We do think year over year, we'll see very significant double-digit decline on the Gaming segment. And at the same time Embedded is going through the bottoming process. We do think the second-half we will see the recovery. So those are the puts and takes. I can talk about it.

Good afternoon. Lisa. I wanted to ask, I mean, there's been so much focus and scrutiny as there should be on the really exciting progression with MI300 and I mean, we've progressed over the last six months from I think some doubts in the investment community on to software and your ability to ramp the product and now you've proven that you're ramping it what, I think you said dozens of customers right across different end-markets. So, it's what I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about and you guys have been open about what some of the forward programs in your traditional server business look like from a roadmap perspective. I'd be interested to hear how you're thinking about the roadmap in your MI accelerator family. Is it going to -- they're going to continue to be parts that are CPU and GPU together? Or is that a primarily a GPU only roadmap? What kind of cadence are you thinking about? I'd just be, any kind of color you can give us on some of the forward roadmap trajectory for that program would be really helpful. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. So, I appreciate the comments. I think the traction that we're getting with the MI300 family is really strong. I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have sort of both the APU version, as well as the GPU version and we continue to use that to differentiate ourselves and that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages. As we go forward, you can imagine, like we did in the EPYC timeframe, we planned multiple generations in sequence. That's the way we're planning the roadmap. One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the roadmap generations here and we are similarly planning acceleration of our roadmap. I would say that we'll talk more about the overall roadmap beyond MI300 as we get into later this year. But you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive roadmap for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Just as a follow-up, I guess one of the questions that I've been getting a lot in different forms is, with respect to the $400 billion TAM that you guys have laid out for 2027. Maybe you could give us a little look under the hood as the, I guess, the -- I've got 100 versions of the same question which is, how the heck did you come up with that number. So, if you could give us a little bit more in terms of are we talking about systems and accelerator cards? Are we talking about just the silicon? Are we talking about full servers? And what kind of sort of unit assumptions? Any kind of thing that you can give us on-market sizing or what gives you the visibility so early into this generative AI trend to give a precise number of three years out? That would be really, really helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,13,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Well, Matt, I don't know-how precise it is, but I think we said approximately $400 billion. But I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates. I think we expect units to grow sort of substantial double-digit percentage. But you should also expect that content is going to grow. So, if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there and just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes. So, there's some ASP uplift in there. And then, what we also do is, we are planning longer-term roadmaps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about sort of the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters. And then, the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years just given as more enterprises adopt. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years. In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM. So, within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs and there will also be some ASICs that are other accelerators that are in that TAM. As we think about sort of the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models, to the largest large language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases. But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the sort of the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

I think you talked about the MI300 cloud workloads being kind of split between the more customer-facing workloads versus internal. Can you talk about how you see the breakdown of that and how is your ecosystem progressing? This is a brand-new chip. It seems impressive they are able to support kind of a broad range of customer-facing workloads and cloud.,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,15,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Joe. So, yes, look, we are really happy with how the MI300 has come up and we've now deployed and working with a number of customers. What we have seen is certainly ROCm 6 has been a very important, as well as the direct optimization with our top cloud customers. We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads. And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect frankly with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but the optimization has gone well. I think to your broader question. The way I look at this is, there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the Cloud side, as well as on the Enterprise side, who have specific training and inferencing workloads. Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them and so our entire tool chain all of our, sort of the overall ROCm suite has really gone through significant progress over the last six to nine months. And then, we're also getting some nice support from the open-source community. So, the work that Hugging Face is doing is tremendous. In terms of just real-time optimization on our hardware, our partnership with OpenAI on Triton and our work across a number of these open source models has helped us actually make very rapid progress.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, I guess a lot of the forecasting of your business that I'm hearing is coming from supply chain and we're sort of hearing AMD is building X in Asia. I guess, how would you ask us to think about that? Are you looking at being kind of sold-out for the year and so the supply chain would be close to revenue? Are you building for the best-case scenario? Just I worry about sometimes expectations when people hear the supply chain numbers. And I'm just curious how you bridge the gap.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, I mean, Joe, I think we updated our revenue expectations this quarter from our original number of $2 billion to $3.5 billion to try to give some bounding on some of the discussion out there. The way to think about the $3.5 billion is these are customers that we're working with, who have given us firm commitments on what they need. As you know, the lead times on these products are quite long. So, it's important to have those forecasts in early and we have a strong order book. So, that gives us good confidence to exceed the $3.5 billion. From a supply chain standpoint, our goal is always to build more supply we -- and so, from that standpoint, we have also worked with our supply chain partners and secured significant capacity. Think about it as first half capacity is tight and more comes on in the second half of the year, but we've certainly made more progress there. So, we do have more supply, and we're going to continue to work with our customers on their deployments and we'll update that number as we go through the year.

Thank you for taking the question. I had one on the MI300 as well, Lisa. I guess, first of all, how should we think about the quarterly trajectory beyond Q1? You talked about Q1 being up sequentially. Is it fair to assume kind of a straight line as we progress through the balance of the year? Or is it more second half skewed? How should we think about that? And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign-up for or sign-off on the MI300. I guess what's the sticking point? Is it just a function of time and you just need a little bit more time to go back-and-forth and tweak things or is there a software kind of concern? I guess what's holding them back at this point?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Toshiya, thanks for the question. So, first on the MI300 trajectory. I think you would expect that revenue should increase every quarter from now through sort of the end of the year, but it will be a bit more second half weighted and part of that is just customers as they're finishing up their qualifications in their lines, as well as sort of how our supply chain is ramping. So, yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half weighted. And then, to your comment about customers, look, we are engaged with all of sort of the large customers. These are all folks that know what's really well, given our deep relationships in EPYC. I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their roadmap. But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space. And I think the question was asked earlier. I think the key is this is not just about MI300 conversation. But it really is about sort of our long-term multi-generational roadmap. And so, that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers, as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or let's call it AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

That's super helpful. And then, as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side. You're guiding Q1 to 52%. I'm curious, again, I'm sure you're not going to give quantitative guidance beyond Q1, but how to think about the trajectory for Q2 and beyond? I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the Instinct ramp. Hopefully, that improves over time. So that should be a tailwind. FPGAs perhaps the second half turns for the better. And you've got server CPU volume growth throughout the year. So, it feels like you've got multiple tailwinds as we think about gross margin progression on a sequential basis. But what are the potential headwinds as we move throughout 2024?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,21,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Toshiya, thank you for the question. Yeah, you're absolutely right. We have some puts and takes that impact our gross margin. We guided the Q1, 120 basis points higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because the higher Data Center contribution actually more than offset the decline of Embedded business in Q1. Going forward, the way to think about it is as you said is the major driver is going to be Data Center business is going to grow much faster than other segment. That mix change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely. I think you also are spot on, the Embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind. With the Data Center GPU, we are at the very early stage of ramp. We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand gross margin and we expect to be accretive to corporate average. So, those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half. I would say the headwinds side continue to be in the first half where we see Embedded business not only Q1 we see sequential decline, Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flattish versus Q1. That is a headwind for us. Because it does have a very nice gross margin. But overall, we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the gross margin improvement, especially second half.

I wanted to get into the competitive environment. First on the Instinct side of things. How that's going? It doesn't seem to be slowing down your ramp whatsoever, but then also on the straight server CPU side of things. Lisa, you said you're gaining share in that area. But as we think about future road maps, pricing incentives, those sorts of things, any meaningful change in the competitive environment that you're seeing throughout 2024?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

So look, I think the environment for us is always competitive. So, I think that has not changed. If I look at the Instinct side, I think we have -- I think we've shown that MI300 and our roadmap are actually very competitive. There are some places where let's call it, it's more even like in the training environment. But as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages. And that's showing through in some of our customer work. So we think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive. And then, as you go into the CPU side again, from our view, with each generation of EPYC, we've continued to gain share. I think, we exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD. And we're still quite underrepresented in Enterprise. So I think there is an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024.

I guess as my follow up. On the Data Center side, another theme that's been pervasive throughout 2023 at least was the GPU side driving out the CPU side. You mentioned that there is still a little bit of cloud digestion going on within your EPYC business. But where do you see that standing? I know you're going to gain share, etc., but you guys fully benefit from the Instinct side for the Data Center GPU side, but what about on the CPU side of things? Is that headwind now behind us or is it still an issue?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,25,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I think we expect the CPU business from a market standpoint to grow, Ross. As we go into 2024, I think the rate and pace of growth will depend a little bit on the macro and just overall capex trends. But from our standpoint, we are starting to see some of our larger customers plan their refresh cycles. There's a lot of let's call it older equipment that has yet to be refreshed and the value proposition for refresh is so strong because the energy efficiency and sort of the footprint of the newer generations are so much better than sort of the four or five year old infrastructure that we do see that refresh cycle happening as we get into 2024. I think the exact timing, we will have to understand more as it, as the market evolves as we go through the year.

So first one, Lisa, from you gave us the $2 billion plus number for MI before, now you've have raised it to over $3.5 billion. And I'm curious what drove the change, was it incremental demand signals, was it supply? And can you supply more of, let's say, demand is $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion, right, what is the limitation? And sort of related to that, on the competition side, your competitor will launch their B100 later in the year, do you think that will change the competitive landscape in anyway?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Vivek. So, I think what we said is as we went from $2 billion to $3.5 billion, it really is mostly customer demand signals. So as orders have come on books and as we've seen programs moved from, let's call it, pilot programs into full manufacturing programs, we have updated the revenue forecast. As I said earlier, from a supply standpoint, we are planning for success. And so, we worked closely with our supply chain partners to ensure that we can ship more than $3.5 billion, substantially more depending on what customer demand is as we go into the second half of the year. And then, in terms of again roadmaps, as I said, we are very focused on a competitive roadmap this -- that sort of what the next generations are beyond MI300. So, I do believe that we have a strong roadmap in-place and continue to work with our customers to sort of adopt our roadmap as quickly as possible.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

And a longer-term question, Lisa. If I look at the success that AMD has enjoyed, its many factors, but a few of them included your early adoption of chiplets and the strong partnerships you have had with TSMC. But now we are seeing your x86 competitor Intel also adopt chiplet or tile technology as they call it. And then, I think recently the manufacturing update they gave, they said, they are two years ahead in terms of incorporating gate all-around and backside our delivery. So, let's assume they are right and they have either caught up to TSMC or maybe they are ahead. What impact does that have on AMD in kind of the medium to longer term?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Vivek. Look, we're always looking at what's next, right? So, on the chiplet technology, I mean, we're sort of on the fourth generation of the chiplet technologies. I think we've learned a lot about how to optimize performance there. We are very aggressive with our adoption of leading-edge technology as it's needed. But I think those are only a few of the pieces. We're also focused on continuing to innovate on architecture and design. So, I think the longer-term question that you ask is I think we're expecting that the competition is going to be on a similar process technology and even in that case, I think we feel like we have a very strong roadmap going forward and will continue to drive both the CPU and the GPU roadmap very aggressively.

Thanks for letting me ask the question, guys. I have two questions. Let me start-off with the accelerator side. The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI300. So, Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power? And then, today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI300 are they primarily buying it for inferencing today or are they using it primarily for tooling? And maybe for Jean. Jean, do you think is it possible for MI300 to finish the year at a run-rate of about $1.5 billion?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,31,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- OK, Harsh. So, let me start, to your question about the value proposition for MI300. Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it though is we intrinsically have more bandwidth and memory capacity on MI300X compared to the competition. And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters you make -- you could potentially do the workload in fewer GPUs. So, it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system. In terms of what customers are using MI300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing and there are also customers that are using it for training. So I think the whole point is being a strong partner. When you put these AI systems in-place, they are sometimes mixed-use systems. So they would be used for both training and inference.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Let me answer your question about the MI300. Exiting Q4 2024, is it possible to get to $1.5 billion? It is possible, right, because Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll see sequential increase in each quarter and more back-end loaded in second-half and we do have a supplies more than $3.5 billion. And of course we will continue to make progress with our customers. So the math, yeah, it's possible, but right now we are really looking at focus on the execution of the current $3.5 billion plus.

Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, you talked about the -- you expected a more shallow ramp of the MI300 and it's clearly doing better than that. So, some of the upside I guess in the near-term is that being pulled forward from the second-half or is this like a step-up or is it more of a step-up in-demand both in the first half and the second-half relative to what you were seeing before?

I don't think it's a pull-forward of demand. I think what it is we wanted to see how long it would take for customers to fully qualify and get their workloads performance. So, yeah, that depends a lot on the actual engineering work that's done and now that we're, let's call it a quarter later, we've seen that it's gone really well.

We'll see what happens over the next few years. But I'd like to kind of reemphasize what I said earlier, even in the case of process parity, we feel very good about our architectural roadmap and all the other things that we add, as we look at our entire portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, adaptive SoCs and kind of put them together to solve problems. I think we feel really good about what we can do with our customers. So, we're always going to be paying attention to sort of the process race, but I think we feel very good about sort of our strategy and how do we continue to sort of push the envelope on the computing roadmaps.

Lisa, I had two questions. My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing or other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Great. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So, look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look. And then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp. And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC. And as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, enterprise customers, and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there. From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity. We think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, a question on the server CPU side. You talked about Genoa growing really nicely in the quarter. I think you talked about both units and volume being bigger than its predecessor. Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year to date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third-quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the fourth-gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted. And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud – you know, cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so, from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both. From a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress, and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter.

Just to build off that last question, Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like 10. So, I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million? Just how has that changed over the course of the last quarter just to level set that Data Center expectation?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, I think for the second half, we said we expect Data Center business to grow approximately 50% versus first half. But right now, based on what we are seeing, we continue to see in that similar range of that 50%. So, we are very happy and pleased about the strong momentum of our Data Center business. On the GPU side, Lisa mentioned about $400 million, around $400 million. As we go through the quarter, we have a strong engagement with the customers.

So, on the gross margin side, we do expect our GPU gross margin to be accretive to corporate average. Of course, right now, we are at a very, very early beginning of the ramp of the product. As you probably know, typically when you ramp new product, it takes some time to improve yield, testing time, manufacturing efficiency.

Lisa, I also wanted to ask about that $2 billion number for Data Center GPU next year. That's still a pretty small portion, obviously, of the total TAM. Where do you think that can go?

I think we all see the growth in generative AI workloads. And the fact is we're just at the very early innings of people truly adopting it for enterprise business productivity applications. So, I think we are big believers in the strength of the market. We previously said we believe that the compound annual growth rate could be 50% over the next three or four years. And so, we think the market is huge and there will be multiple winners in this market. Certainly, from our standpoint, we want to be -- we're playing to win and we think MI300 is a great product, but we also have a strong road map beyond that for the next couple of generations. And we would like to be a significant player in this market. So, we'll see how things play out.

And then Jean, I just wanted to ask on March. I know that there's a lot of moving parts. It sounds like Data Center is up, but PC is going to be down, normal seasonal. And Embedded and Gaming sound down as well. So, can you just help us shape sort of how to think about March? Is it down a smidge? Is it flat? Could it be up a little bit?

But just to help you with some of the color, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we said the Data Center GPU revenue will be flattish sequentially. That's the first thing, right? The mix will shift from El Capitan majority in Q4 to predominantly more for AI in Q1. So, because of the long lead time manufacturing cycle, we feel like it's going to be a similar level of revenue with the Data Center GPU. But in general, if you look at our business, we do have a seasonality. Typically, Q1, the Client business, server business, Gaming business seasonally is down. Of course, right now, we definitely have a little bit more seasonality, given Embedded and the Gaming dynamics we are seeing right now. Server and Client typically were down sequentially, seasonally too. But overall, I think we are really focused on just execution. We probably can provide more color when we get close to Q1 2024, and especially, Lisa, please add if we have any color we can provide on the whole year 2024.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

No, I think that covers it. When we look at the various pluses and minuses, I think we feel very good about the Data Center business. It continues to be a strong growth driver for us as we think about 2024 for both server as well as our MI300 clients as well, we think incrementally improves from a market standpoint as well as we believe we can gain share, given the strength of our product portfolio. And then we have the headwinds of Embedded in the inventory correction that we'll go through in the first half and the console cycle. So, I think those are the puts and takes.

Lisa, on the MI300, many of your hyperscaler customers have internal ASIC solutions ready or in the process of getting them ready. So, if inference is the primary workload for MI300, do you think it is exposed to replacement by internal ASICs over time? Or do you think both MI300 and ASICs can coexist, right, along with the incumbent GPU solution?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I think, Vivek, when we look at the set of AI workloads going forward, we actually think they're pretty diverse. I mean, you have sort of the large language model training and inference then you have what you might do in terms of fine-tuning off of a foundational model and then you have, let's call it, straight inferencing what you might do there. So, I think within that framework, we absolutely believe that MI300 has a strong place in the market, and that's what our customers are telling us and we're working very closely with them. So, yes, I think there will be other solutions, but I think for the -- particularly for the LLMs, I think GPUs are going to be the processing of choice and MI300's very, very capable.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units, seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs. So, I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right? If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in server is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So, just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments? And secondly, is there a difference in kind of the unit and ASP interplay on the server CPU side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think it's a good point, Vivek. So, I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed. I think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, fourth-gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that. So, I do think there is the framework -- that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth. So, from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024.

I want to ask on the Embedded side. I think last quarter, you kind of talked about the headwinds being mostly in the communications end market. You're guiding it down in December. I was curious if that weakness is spread. And then your competitor talked about kind of a reset getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Just kind of curious how you framed that reset. You said it'd be weak to the first half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,24,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Blayne. So, I think when we look at end markets, I think communications was weak in sort of last quarter and it certainly continues to be weak. We see 5G sort of capex just down overall. On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies. The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So, from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid. And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that. So, we have to get through sort of the next couple of quarters of inventory correction, and then we believe we'll return to growth in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then I just wanted to ask on the PC market. I think you and Intel have seen -- you were under-shipping in the first half. Maybe you're kind of over shipping a little bit now, restocking. I'm just kind of curious of your perspective of what that normalized run rate is in terms of the size of the PC market and kind of any perspective if inventory levels are starting to move back up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I would say, again, Blayne, when we looked at sort of the third quarter and sort of the environment that we're in now, I think inventory levels are relatively normalized, and so the selling and consumption are fairly close. We were building up for a holiday season that is a strong season for us overall. When I think about the size of the market, I think from a consumption standpoint this year is probably somewhere like 250 million to 255 million units or so. We expect some growth going into 2024 as we think about sort of the AI PC cycle and some of the Windows refresh cycles that are out there. And I think the PC market returns to, let's call it, a typical seasonality, in which underneath that, we have a strong product portfolio. And we are very much focused on growing in places like high-end gaming, ultrathins, premium consumer as well as commercial. So, those are -- that's how sort of we see the PC market.

Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to maybe ask the AI question a little bit differently, not just focused on your GPU portfolio but more broadly. I think one of the big surprises to a lot of us is how quickly the AI market changed from accelerator cards to selling full servers or full systems for your primary competitor. And they've done a lot of innovation not just on GPU but on CPU on their own custom interconnect, etc. So, what I'd like to hear a little bit of an update on is just how you think about your road map going forward across CPU, GPU, and networking and particularly the networking part as you look to continue to advance your AI portfolio. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,28,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together. We are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs, as well as the networking capability. Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So, going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems. We believe that there are others who are more set up for that. But I think from a definition standpoint and when we're doing development, we are certainly doing development with the notion of what that full system will look like. And we'll work very closely with our partners to ensure that that's well defined so that it's easy for customers to adopt our solutions.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

As my second question, Jean, I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit and just, I guess, compliment you and the team on being able to guide up for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year, and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by a third. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year. Obviously, Client margins got better. But maybe you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin, and inside of each segment, where you're making progress because I imagine some of that progress is pretty positive underneath.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,30,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Matt, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So, let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points. As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially. There are two primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin. And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment. So, that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again. I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half.

Lisa, I had a question on the MI300 side of things. When you go to market, obviously, there's been shortages this year of GPU accelerators, and so a second source is definitely needed. But beyond just providing that second source role, can you just walk us through some of the competitive advantages that the customer lists that you're going to talk about on the sixth is finding to be so attractive relative to your primary competitor?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think there's a couple of different things, Ross. I mean, if we start with, it's just a very capable product. The way it's designed from a triplet standpoint, we have a very strong compute as well as memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In inference, in particular, that's very helpful. And the way to think about it is on these larger language models, you can't fit the model on one GPU. You actually need multiple GPUs. And if you have more memory, you can actually use fewer GPUs to infer those models, and so it's very beneficial from a total cost of ownership standpoint. From a software standpoint, this has been perhaps the area where we've had to invest more and do more work. Our customers and partners are actually moving toward an area where they're more able to move across different hardware so really optimizing at the higher-level frameworks. And that's reducing the barrier of entry of sort of taking on a new solution. And we're also talking very much about, going forward, what the road map is. It's very similar to our EPYC evolution. When you think about sort of the -- our closest partners in the cloud environment, we work very closely to make each generation better. So, I think MI300 is an excellent product, and we'll keep evolving on that as we go through the next couple of generations.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Our team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities. I think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top-line revenue growth much faster than opex growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion.

Lisa, I had a strategic one for you and then somewhat of a tactical one. On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so, if that's the case down the line one year or two years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Harsh, maybe I should just take a step back and just talk about sort of the engagement that we have with our data center customers. When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond, process technology is only one piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging. We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So, it's really the holistic product. And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only one aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency. So, from a -- from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So, I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our road map is headed.

There's a lot of excitement around AI, and we are very much clear that that is the No. 1 priority from a growth standpoint going forward. But the EPYC CPU business, we feel like we've consistently gained share throughout the last few years. And even with that, we're still underrepresented in large portions of the market, right? We're underrepresented in enterprise. We've seen some nice sort of sequential growth and nice prospects there, but there's a lot more we can do in enterprise. And we're still underrepresented in cloud third-party workloads, which, again, it's a -- you have to sell through the cloud manufacturers.

I know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize?

Sure, Stacy. Let me take that and then Jean might add a few comments. So, without getting very specific, I would say I think your comments about Data Center and Client are correct. And then from an Embedded and Gaming standpoint, we would say Embedded, think about it down similar levels sort of in the teens compared to sort of Q3 was down in the teens and Q4 will be down in the teens. And then Gaming, from a console standpoint, we do expect that to be down a bit more than that. And then as we go into Q1, again without being -- there are lots of things that need to happen. We would expect that both gaming and embedded would be down into Q1 as well and sort of the other comments would be more around seasonality. Does that help?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

For my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So, I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else. But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive. Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year over year like in '24  versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Stacy, I'll say the first thing is if you look at 2023, it's a very unusual year for the industry, right, especially the PC market. It's one of the worst down cycles during the last three decades. So, during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half. Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then with both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half. So, that's how we think about it right now. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.

There was an article suggesting that you guys could be interested in doing some ARM-based CPUs. I guess I'd love any thoughts that you have there on that architecture for PC. But also Apple has their M3 out now. It seems pretty robust. Qualcomm has an X Elite new chip. It was rumored NVIDIA might be doing that as well. Would love your expectations for this market.

Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So, look, the way we think about ARM, ARM is a partner in many respects so we use ARM throughout parts of our portfolio. I think as it relates to PCs, x86 is still the majority of the volume in PCs. And if you think about sort of the ecosystem around x86 and Windows, I think it's been a very robust ecosystem. What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data. And so, I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about. It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers. And from that standpoint, I think that we have a very exciting portfolio that I feel good about over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I mean, Chris, the way I think about sort of FPGAs in the data center, it's another compute element. We do use FPGAs or there are FPGAs in a number of the systems. I would say from a revenue contribution standpoint, it's still relatively small sort of in the near term. We have some design wins going forward that we would see that content grow but that won't be so much in 2024, that will be beyond that. And part of our value proposition, I think, to our data center partners is, look, whatever compute element you need, whether it's CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or DPUs or -- we have the ability to sort of bring those components together. And that is a strong point as we think about just how heterogeneous these data centers are going forward. So, thank you for that.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,1,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results. I guess, Lisa, my first question is around the data center business. I think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've, arguably, never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength, and obviously in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your data center business by 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back half? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. It's a very dynamic market right now in the data center. We certainly see -- let me go through some of the pieces. So, on the positive side, we certainly see that acceleration of AI demand. From our standpoint, we see it in a couple of ways. We have a number of design wins in AI deployments as the CPU that goes with GPUs, as well as other accelerators. So, in the head nodes, we've seen that positive on the CPU side. We've also seen some strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently shipping right now. And we see very strong pull on the MI300 accelerators that are starting production in the fourth quarter. So, those are the positive market dynamics as we go into the second half of the year. We also see some of the softer cloud spend that is happening outside of AI as some of the cloud vendors are optimizing their capex. And enterprise, I would say, is still on the weaker side. But with all that in place, we are expecting a large ramp in second half for our data center business and weighted toward the fourth quarter. And we are still looking at a zip code of, let's call it, 50% plus or minus second half to first half. So, it's a big ramp, but when we look at all the components, I think that the customer pull is certainly there. And it's exciting to be in this part of the industry.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Thank you for that, Lisa. I guess as my follow-up, still sticking with the Data center business. Your company is aggressively trying to ramp both the hardware and the software side of the MI300 programs to support AI. There's been some conflicting reports as to whether all of those deployments are time. I think you've, in the prepared script, said what you guys think about that. I guess my question is really around the software work and the hardware itself that you're doing with your lead customers. Maybe you could give a little bit about, firstly, how the customer feedback has been on the performance of the hardware itself and, secondly, how you think the software work you're doing with your lead customers will translate into other customer deployments as we work through next year. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, absolutely. So, if I give you just some color on how the customer engagements are going, there's very strong customer interest across the board in our AI solutions, that includes, let's call it, multiple Tier 1 hyperscalers that we're engaged with. It includes some large enterprises. And it also includes this new category of some of these AI-centric companies that are sort of very forward-looking in terms of how they're deploying and building AI solutions. So, from that aperture, we made a lot of progress with our ROCm software stack. I'm actually -- there is a lot more to do, but I would say the progress that we've made has been significant. We're getting lots of feedback from those lead customers. We're seeing the benefits of the optimization, so working also on the higher-level model frameworks, the work that we're doing with the PyTorch Foundation, the work that we're doing with Onyx, with Triton. And the key is we're getting significant real-time feedback from some of these lead customers. So, we're learning at a very fast pace. In terms of the feedback on performance, a number of companies have now been able to look at MI250 across a broad range of workloads, and that's a good translation as you go to MI300, and the feedback has been quite positive. We have customers sampling either on our lab systems, they're accessing the hardware, or sampling in their labs. And I would say, so far, very positive. The pull is there. There is a lot of work to be done, but we feel very good about the progress of our overall AI solutions for the data center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking the question. Just building on Matt's comments or question, I just want to go back to the implied revenue for the data center business for the back half of the year. Jean, I think, last quarter, you had alluded to, for the full year, the expectation is still growing 10% or double digits, I should say, for the full year, the data center business, just confirming that. And what I'm really trying to ask is, given the guidance of flat year-over-year growth in data center in 3Q, it would seem, if my math is correct, you're implying a 50% or so increase sequentially into 4Q. I'm just trying to frame exactly how you're thinking about the cadence of what 4Q looks like, underpinning that expectation.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. I think as Lisa just mentioned earlier, it's a very dynamic market. There are puts and takes. We have a tremendously strong momentum with our product portfolio, but there is continued softness in enterprise market, and also call it, the optimization is still ongoing. So, overall, on balance, we think year over year, it's probably more like a high single digit.

So, we have been really investing in our supply chain, the data center growth is so strategic to us, that this has been part of the strategy. So, if you look at all aspects of the supply chain, from the wafers to the backend capacity, to some of the specific components that you need to do something of the class of MI300, we've worked with the entire supply chain. We feel that we have ample supply for an aggressive ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2024.

Thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is on the data center business as well. And I just wanted to follow up on the Q3 to Q4 dynamic. And I do apologize if I missed this, but in the implied growth rate in data center in Q4, can you speak to what percentage of supercomputing? I think there is a big project that's slated to ship in Q4. And is there any contribution from the Instinct series outside of supercomputing as well or is it primary your server CPU franchise?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, as Jean said, into the third quarter, we expect double-digit sequential growth in data center, that's primarily EPYC. So, that's primarily the Zen 4, let's call it the combination of Genoa and Bergamo, as that continues to ramp. As we go into the fourth quarter, there is an implied significant ramp in revenue. I think there are multiple components to that. So, there is -- the server CPU side will continue to ramp as we see Zen 4 ramp. There is a sort of large, call it, lumpy supercomputer win, so our El Capitan win will be in the fourth quarter primarily, with a little bit in the first quarter. And then we will have contribution from both MI300X going to large AI customers as they start their initial ramps, as well as MI250s with a number of customers who have now -- view that as a very good option for some of the workloads that are not necessarily the largest language models or the largest parameters, but let's call it more sort of the other AI workload. So, those are the components of the fourth quarter implied growth. Lots of pieces to it, but clearly, a big piece of it is the MI300 ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thank you, Lisa. And then shifting gears a little bit and follow-up question on the client side. You talked about the business returning to profitability in Q3, which is great. But you're still well below where you were in '21 and '22 from an operating margin perspective. Can you speak to the competitive landscape in the client business? Is there a path back to, call it, 20%, 30% operating margins there? And do you have any cost initiatives ongoing to get you back to that level of profitability in client?

Maybe let me start, and then maybe Jean can add some comment. So, look, I think the PC business has been fairly volatile over the last number of quarters, from the pandemic highs to some of the inventory digestion that we were all dealing with. I can say that I'm pleased to say that I think the growth that we're seeing -- that we saw during the second quarter and that we see in the second half is the strength of our product portfolio. I think the Ryzen 7000 series is doing well, there's good customer pull. I think from a competitive dynamic standpoint, the business is always competitive, but we feel good about. The most important thing that was a little bit of a drag on operating margins was the revenue being low, as well as some of the -- we had a case where the sell-in was below consumption as we were normalizing inventory levels in the supply chain. As we get past that, what we see is I think the client business continues to grow. We believe that client will grow into 2024 as well. In terms of some of the cost initiatives, we have been, let's call it, optimizing sort of the overall R&D footprint, but maybe I'll let Jean comment some more.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

On the opex side, the team has done a great job during this process to really optimize the investment in client, on the segment to be more efficient and effective. If you look at the overall common company level, our opex has been largely flattish. But we are investing in AI, data center, and the strategic priorities we have which generate a much higher return on investment. So, we have optimized it.

The first one, just a clarification, would it be reasonable to assume that your GPU accelerator sales could be about, say, $500-ish million this year, so about 7%, 8% of data center sales? And if that is the right number, does it mean your server CPU sales are effectively flattish year on year this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,26,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Vivek, I don't know that I would go into quite that granularity. What we will say is the GPU sales in the first half of the year were very low as we were sort of in a product transition timing as we go into the second half of the year. In particular, the fourth quarter, we'll have MI300 ramp. I think your number may be a little bit high in terms of the GPU sales, but overall, in general, I think our expectation is that, as Jean said, the data center business, given all of the market dynamics, we see it up high single digits year on year, we see much better second half compared to first half. And I think the product portfolio and the ramp of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as the ramp of MI300 are key components of the second-half ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, just kind of a broader question on AI accelerators in the commercial market, so I'm excluding the Supercomputing, the El Capitan projects, etc. What is AMD's specific edge in this market? You know there are already strong and established kind of merchant players, there are a number of ASIC options, a number of your traditional competitors, Intel and others, and several start-ups are also ramping. So, my question is, what is AMD's specific niche in this market? What is your value proposition and how sustainable is it? Because you're just starting to sample the product now. So, I'm trying to get some realistic sense of how big it can be and what the specific kind of niche and differentiation is for AMD in this market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,28,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Vivek. So, I think maybe let me take a step back and just talk about sort of our investments in AI. So, our investments in AI are very broad and I know there's a lot of interest around data center, but I don't want us to lose track of the investments on the edge as well as in the client. But to your question on what is our value proposition in the data center, I think what we have shown is that we have very strong capability with supercomputing, as you've mentioned. And then, as you look at AI, there are many different types of AI. If you look across training and inference, sort of the largest language models, and what drives some of the performance in there when we look at MI300, MI300 is actually designed to be a highly flexible family of products that looks across all of these different segments. And in particular, where we've seen a lot of interest is in the sort of large language model inference. So, MI300X has the highest memory bandwidth, has the highest memory capacity. And if you look at that inference workload, it's actually a very -- it's very dependent on those things. That being said, we also believe that we have a very strong value proposition and training as well. When you look across those workloads and the investments that we're making, not just today, but going forward with our next generation MI400 series and so on and so forth, we definitely believe that we have a very competitive and capable hardware roadmap. I think the discussion about AMD, frankly, has always been about the software roadmap, and we do see a bit of a change here on the software side. Number one, we've put a tremendous amount of resource on it. So, bringing together our former Xilinx software team, together with the AMD sort of based software team, we've dramatically increased the resources. And also, the focus has now been on sort of optimizing at these higher-level models. So, if you think about the frameworks around PyTorch and Triton and Onyx, I think many of the new AI-centric companies are actually optimizing at a different level, and they're working very closely with us. So, in this place where AI is tremendously exciting, I think there will be multiple winners. And we will be first to say that there are multiple winners. But we think our portfolio is actually fairly unique in the sense that we do have CPUs, GPUs, we have the accelerator technology with Ryzen AI on the PC side as well as in the embedded side with our Xilinx portfolio. So, I think it's a pretty broad and capable portfolio.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,30,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first go back to the Q4 data center guide. So, if I do my math right, it's something like $700 million sequentially in data center from Q3 to Q4. So, how much of that is MI300 versus CPU? And given the lumpiness of the El Capitan piece, what does that imply for the potential seasonality into Q1 as most of it rolls off?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,31,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So, it is a large ramp, Stacy, into the fourth quarter. I think the largest piece of that is the MI300 ramp. But there is also a significant component that's just the EPYC processor ramp with, as I said, the Zen 4 portfolio. In terms of the lumpiness of the revenue and where it goes into 2024. Let me give you kind of a few pieces. So, I think there was a question earlier about how much of the MI300 revenue was AI-centric versus let's call it supercomputing centric. The larger piece is supercomputing, but it's meaningful revenue contribution from AI. As we go into 2024, our expectation is again, let me go back to the customer interest on MI300X is very high. There are a number of customers that are looking to deploy as quickly as possible. So, we would expect early deployments as we go into the first half of 2024, and then we would expect more volume in the second half of '24 as those things fully qualify. So, it is going to be a little bit lumpy as we get through the next few quarters. But our visibility is such that there are multiple customers that are looking to deploy as soon as possible. And we're working very closely with them to do the co-engineering necessary to get them ramped.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

For my follow-up, just gross margins coming up in the back in the second. I mean, they still kind of missed in the quarter. I know they rounded up to 50%, but they were 49.7%. I know you're guiding 51 for Q3. Jean, where do you see gross margins sitting like in Q4 as we exit the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,35,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yeah. I think the gross margin is, for us, the primary driver as we discussed in the past, it's really mixed. And if you look at our guidance or outlook of Q3, gross margin of 51%, it's more than one percentage point improvement sequentially despite of very significant headwind from embedded business declining in Q3. So, the data center and the client business are expected to grow double-digit sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margins, which actually more than offset the headwind from embedded business. So, going to Q4, again we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. I would say one thing is you will have similar dynamics, right? Data centers expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from embedded business declining sequentially. So, overall, we do expect gross margin to improve from this level going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, look, when I look at the embedded business, I think we should start by remembering that we're coming off of six quarters of very strong growth. I mean, this business has performed extremely well, and very pleased with the overall momentum in the business. To your exact question of what we're seeing in the markets, we're actually seeing the core markets hold up pretty well, so let's call it aerospace and defense strong; industrial vision and healthcare, strong; test and emulation strong. We are seeing communications weakness. So, that is the primary driver of the second-half commentary. And there's also some inventory optimization, as you might expect, since our league times have come down over the last several months. So, in terms of zip code, I would say think of it as double-digit down sequentially in the third quarter, and that's the current view that we have. But overall, the business has been extremely strong for us, so I think this is an expected decline as we come off the cycle.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Tim, thanks for the question. I think as we ramp those product lines in Q3 and Q4, you will see inventory come down first in Q3 and Q4 again. I think the inventory days of inventory probably will be around 110 to 120 days. The key thing is, right, is if you look at a lot of our product, they are like advanced process technology, five-nanometer, four-nanometer, six. The manufacturing cycle tends to be long. So, in the longer term, you should expect us from days of inventory be more around 100 to 120 days versus traditionally like 80 days or 75 days. That will be too short for, really, most advanced process technologies.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then my follow-up is for you, Lisa. I mean, if you kind of add up the units, the customer interest, you can easily get to several hundred thousand units, it seems to me, for the MI300X next year. So, the question really is on the supply chain, and particularly Cohost, do you think that's going to be a bottleneck for you? I know that, you know, they've been expanding capacity. I know you've been trying to procure more there. Can you sort of talk about that and sort of do you think that supply could become a limiting factor you next year?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,45,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely. So, I'm not going to comment on the exact units, but what I will say is that we've been focused on the supply chain for MI300 for quite some time. It is tight. There's no question that it's tight in the industry. However, we have sort of commitments for significant capacity across the entire supply chain. So, co-host is one piece of it, high bandwidth memory is another piece of it and then just the general capacity requirements and look, our goal is to make this a significant growth driver for AMD, I think it's a great market opportunity. We love the engagements with customers, it's our responsibility to provide the supply for the demand and so that's what we've been working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And more on the MI300 opportunity that you guys called out as a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity.

Have you looked at the performance? How do they perform? Are you excited about that? And then, in terms of hyperscale uptake, is it the X version, the GPU-only version, that you expect to be the biggest seller here?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,49,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, there were a lot of aspects to that question, Chris. So, let me try to give you some framework here. I don't think we're ready to talk about timing yet of revenue numbers. What we will say is we do believe it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. I think 2024 is a very important year for us. Ramping MI300 in multiple customers over the next several quarters is very important. I think I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the customer interest is actually diverse, which is great. It includes sort of what you would expect in terms of the large Tier 1 hyperscalers. But I think these new class of sort of AI-focused companies have been working very closely with us, and then some of the large enterprises are also looking at ramping up their efforts. The performance that we see is strong. I think the large language model work that we've done, we've done a lot of it on MI250, and we've seen very good results that's on both training as well as inference. I think as we go through MI300 again, the early results are strong. For AI applications, what we're seeing now is MI300X. So, let's call it the GPU-only version is the one that is sort of most prevalent in the AI customer engagement. But the MI300A, actually, which is sort of where we have the CPU and the GPU more closely coupled together is also of interest. So, I think the key is I think we've built a platform that does allow people to kind of choose what is best for the models and for the workloads that they're trying to enable. And that's what we're working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

I think Siena fits again. It's as you said, it's a niche that we haven't previously been focused on. I think our interactions with the telco suppliers are they're anxious to have Siena be a part of their portfolio. Siena is also one that we'll use for other edge applications, or let's call it lower-end applications that need the performance of Zen 4, but perhaps not the heavy platform that we have on the Genoa and Bergamo.

Let me just make sure I get the statement clear. So, both MI300A and MI300X will be part of the ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter. And as we go into next year for the AI-specific applications, we are more heavily weighted toward MI300X, just given sort of where the software is written. And to your question about gross margins at the corporate level, so we would expect that our AI business will be accretive to gross margins at the corporate level. And obviously, as you start the ramp, there's a little bit of learning, but overall, we expect it to be accretive to our corporate gross margins.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then for my follow-up, I just had, I guess, clarification. So, it sounds like most of the MI revenue you have in the hopper right now for at least the committed revenue is LCAP. Is that true? And do you have other, I guess, confirmed or hard orders for that, or maybe just spend some time telling us how you're working with the customers or what it takes for them to go from, ""Hey, we are interested,"" to, ""Here is the purchase order?""",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, maybe if your question is do we have other customers who are committed to MI300 other than LCAP, the answer is yes. We have a number of customers who are actually committed. And the way these things go, actually it's not different, not very different than how a server ramp goes, right? I mean, one starts with an initial deployment, ensures that the software works, ensures that we have all of the reliability and capability in the data center, and then they ramp from that. I will say the difference in AI deployments is, I think, customers are willing to go very quickly. There is sort of a desire and agility because we all want to accelerate the amount of AI compute that's out there. And so, the speed in which customers are engaged and customers are making decisions is actually faster than they would in sort of a normal, sort of regular environment. And that's great.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,61,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. And Lisa, we are looking forward to an exciting second half for your company. I had a quick question on the server share. Do you think that there is a theoretical limit to the share that AMD can get? Historically initially we heard 80-20 was a pervading rule, and then you busted through that. Now, we are hearing customers say 70-30 is more like it. More importantly, are there any large vendors for your server business where you have significantly more than 30% share, let's say, 40% or even 50% share? And I have a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. Look, in the server business, I think the most important thing for our customers is that we have a strong roadmap, and it's a roadmap that they can count on. And we've been building that sort of working model, that roadmap, and the trust over the past four or five years. So, I don't think there is any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their data centers more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise. And that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software. So, we believe that we have leadership today, and we are very, very focused on ensuring that we continue leadership in the market. And with that, there is an opportunity to continue to gain share in the server market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

On my second one, can you help us think a little bit about the generative AI spend, let's say, if you can side press some kind of metric, and so, how many dollars of spend today are you seeing from your customers on generative AI for let's say each dollar of regular server CPU spend? Is there a metric that we can think of? Is there a trend today?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,64,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Harsh, the best way to answer that, and again, we are all sort of -- it's all on crystal ball as to what's going to happen over the next four or five years. There is no question that the demand for generative AI solutions is very high, and there is a lot of compute capacity that needs to put in. The way we size the market is, it can perhaps grow at a rate of, let's call it 50% CAGR plus or minus over the next three or four years. So, that would take us to $150 billion by the time we get to 2027. Now, that's all accelerators in the data centers, so that includes GPUs, that includes other ASICs and other accelerators. But I think we have an opportunity to address a large portion of that market. So, that makes it very clear priority for us. It's our No. 1 strategic priority, and we will continue to work closely with our customers as they optimize between CPU and GPU or spend.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,1,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for the question. For my first one, Lisa, when I look at your full-year Data Center outlook for some growth, that implicitly suggest Data Center, right, could be up 30% in the second half versus the first half, right? And I'm curious, what is your confidence and visibility and some of the assumptions that go into that view? Is it -- do you think there is a much bigger ramp in the new products? Is it enterprise recovery? Is it pricing? So just give us a sense for how we should think about the confidence and visibility of the strong ramp that is implied in your second-half Data Center outlook?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Right. So, Vivek, thanks for the question. Maybe let me give you some context on what's going on in the Data Center right now. First of all, we have said that it's a mixed environment in the Data Center. So the first half of the year, there are some of the larger cloud customers that are working through some inventory and optimization as well as a weaker enterprise. As we go into the second half of the year, we see a couple of things. First, our road map is very strong. So the feedback that we're getting working with our customers on, it's ramping well. It is very differentiated in terms of TCO and overall performance. So we think it's very well-positioned. Much of the work that we've done in the first half of the year -- in the first quarter and here in the second quarter is to ensure that we complete all of that work such that we can ramp across a broader set of workloads as we go into the second half of the year. And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we're also ramping Bergamo. So that's on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get toward the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we'll have to see how the the year play about how we're positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,3,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- All right. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how do you see the market share evolve in the Data Center in the second half? Do you think that the competitive gap between your and your competitors' products, has that narrowed? Or you still think that in the second half, you have a chance to gain market share in the Data Center?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Absolutely, Vivek. Well, I mean, we've gained share nicely over the last four years. When you look at our Data Center progression, it's actually been pretty steady. As we go into the second half of this year, I think we continue to believe that we have a very strong competitive position. So we do think that positions us well to gain share. In the conversations that we're having with customers, I think they're enthusiastic about Zen 4 and what it can bring into cloud workloads as well as enterprise workloads. I think actually Genoa is extremely well-positioned for enterprise where we have been underrepresented. So we feel good about the road map. I mean, obviously, it's competitive, but we feel very good about our ability to continue to gain share.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the Embedded business. It's been a really strong business for you since the acquisition of Xilinx, you're guiding the business down sequentially in Q2. Is this sort of the macro/cycle kicking in? Or is it something supply related? If you can kind of expand on the Q2 outlook there and your expectations for the second half, that would be helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Absolutely, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. I mean I think the Embedded business has performed extremely well over the last four or five quarters. Q1 was another record for the Embedded business. When we look underneath it, there is a broad set of market segments that we have exposure to, and the majority of them are actually doing very well. Our thought process for sort of modest decline into Q2 is that we did have a bunch of backlog that we're in the process of clearing and that backlog will clear in Q2, and then we expect that the growth will moderate a bit. We still very much like the positioning of sort of our aerospace and defense, our industrial, our test and emulation business our automotive business. We expect wireless trends to be a little bit weaker as well as consumer trends. So those are the kind of the puts and takes in the market. But I would say the business has performed well above our expectations.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side of things. In your slide deck, I think you're guiding gross margins up half over half in the second half. Can you maybe speak to the puts and takes and the drivers as you think about gross margins over the next six to nine months?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thank you for the question. Our gross margin is primarily driven by mix. If you look at the first half -- first-quarter performance and second-quarter guide, we are very pleased with the strong gross margin performance in both the Data Center and the embedded segment. We haven't been seeing headwinds from a Client segment impacting our gross margin. Going to the second half, we do expect gross margin improvement because Data Center is going up and the Embedded continue to be relatively strong. The pace of improvement in the second half actually will be largely dependent on the Client segment. We think the Client segment gross margin is also going to improve. But overall, it's going to be below corporate average. So the pace of improvement of gross margin could be dependent on the pace for the Client business recovery in second half. But in the longer term, right, when we look at our business opportunities, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center and Embedded segment. So we are building very good about longer-term gross margin going up continuously.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,11,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. I guess the first question going back on just like the cadence of the server CPU cycle with Genoa and Bergamo. And I think it's great to hear that you guys are on track to launch Bergamo here. But there's been some discussion here throughout this last quarter around some DDR5 challenges. I think there's PMEC issues. I'm just curious of how you -- if those issues have presented themselves or how you would characterize the cadence of the ramp cycle of Genoa at this point?,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,12,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Aaron. So yes, look, I think Genoa, we always said, as we launched it, that it would be a little bit more of a longer transition compared to Milan because it is a new platform. So it is the new DDR5, it's PCI Gen 5. And for many of our top customers, they're also doing other things other than upgrading the CPUs. So from that standpoint, I would say the ramp is going about as we expected. We've seen a lot of interest, a lot of customer engineering work that we're doing together in the data centers with our customers, we feel great about the set of workloads, and we see expansion in the workloads going forward. So overall, our expectation is, particularly as we go into the second half, we'll see Genoa ramp more broadly. But Genoa and Milan are going to coexist throughout the year, just given sort of the breadth of platforms that we have.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then I'm curious if my second question just real quick is the MI300, if we look out beyond just the deployment through the course of this year, how do you guys think about success in that data center GPU market to we think about beyond just?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Aaron. So back to the DDR5 question, we haven't seen anything specific on DDR5. And it's just normal platform bring up that we're seeing. Now as it relates to your question about MI300, look, we're really excited about the AI opportunity. I think that is success for us is having a significant part of the AI overall opportunity. AI for us is broader than cloud. I mean it also includes what we're doing in Clients and Embedded. But specifically, as it relates to MI300, MI300 is actually very well-positioned for both HPC or supercomputing workloads as well as for AI workloads. And with the recent interest in generative AI, I would say the pipeline for MI300 has expanded considerably here over the last few months, and we're excited about that. We're putting a lot more resources. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the work that we're doing, sort of taking our Xilinx and sort of the the overall AMD AI efforts and collapsing them into one organization that's primarily to accelerate our AI software work as well as platform work. So success for MI3100 is for sure, a significant part of sort of the growth in AI in the cloud. And I think we feel good about how we're positioned there.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon, everybody. Lisa, my first question, I think just the way the business has trended, right, with enterprise and with China in the data center market being a bit softer recently, and it seems like that's kind of continuing into the second quarter. It occurs to me that a big percentage of your data center business, particularly in server in the second half of the year is going to be driven by U.S. hyperscale. And I guess my question is the level of visibility you have to unit volumes, to pricing, to timing of ramps. If you could walk us through that a little bit, given it's customer concentrated. I imagine you have some level of visibility. And you mentioned growth for the year-end data center. If you could be a little bit more precise there, that's -- I understand there's market dynamics, but it's a bit of a big comment and helps to just push me to ask about quantifying the growth for the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Matt, thanks for the question. So look, I think as we work with our largest cloud customers in the Data Center segment, particularly with our EPYC CPUs, we have very good conversations in terms of what their ramp plans are, what their qualification plans are, which workloads, which instances. So I feel that we have good visibility. Obviously, some of this is still dependent on overall macro situation and overall demand. But our view is that there is a lot of good progress in the Data Center. Now in terms of quantification, as I said, there's a lot of puts and takes. My view is that enterprise will improve as we go into the second half, and we're even seeing, I would say, some very early signs of some improvement in China as well. So our view is, I think, double-digit Data Center growth is what we currently see. And certainly, we would like to ramp Genoa and Bergamo as a large piece given the strength of those products, we'd like to see them grow share here over the next couple of quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,18,Matt Ramsey,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Lisa, that's helpful. For my follow-up question, I think in the prepared scripts, we're obviously under-shipping sell-through to clear the channel in the Client business in the first half of the year. And I think the language that was used was seasonal improvements in the second half. So are you guys expecting to come back to shipping in line with sell-through so to stop under-shipping demand? And then for on top of that seasonal improvements in the market? Or -- and if you could just kind of help me think about the magnitude and the moving pieces in Client for the second half?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So we've been under-shipping sort of consumption in the Client business for about three quarters now. And certainly, our goal has been to normalize the inventory in the supply chain so that shipments would be closer to consumption. We expect that, that will happen in the second half of the year, and that's what the comment meant that we believe that there will be improvements in the overall inventory positioning. And then we also believe that the client market is stabilizing. So Q1 was the bottom for our business as well as for the overall market. From what we see although it will be a gradual set of improvements, we do see that the overall market should be better in the second half of the year. We like our product portfolio a lot. I'm excited about having AI-enabled on our Ryzen 7000 series. And we have leadership notebook platforms with Dragon Range. Our desktop road map is also quite strong with our new launch of the Verizon 7000 X3D products. And so I think here in the second quarter, we'll still under-ship consumption a bit. And by the second half of the year, we should be more normalized between shipments and consumption, and we expect some seasonal improvement into the second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Joe, this is a bit harder because every customer is different. What we're seeing is different customers are at a different place in their sort of overall cycle. But let me say it this way though. I think we have good visibility with all of our large customers in terms of what they're trying to do for the quarter, for the year. Obviously, some of that will depend on how the macro plays out. But from our viewpoint, I think we're also going through a product transition between Milan and Genoa and some of these workloads. So if you put all those things into the conversation, that's why our comment was that we will -- we do believe that the second quarter will grow modestly and then there'll be more growth in the second half of the year as it relates to the Data Center business. So there lots of puts and takes, every customers in a bit of a different cycle. But overall, the number of workloads that they're going to be using AMD on, we believe, will expand as we go through the next few quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

We mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the work that was done on the LUMI supercomputer with generative AI models. We've continued to do quite a bit of library optimization with MI250 and software optimization to really ensure that we could increase the overall performance and capabilities. MI300 looks really good. I think from everything that we see, the workloads have also changed a bit in terms of -- whereas a year ago, much of the conversation was primarily focused on training. Today, that has migrated to sort of large language model inferencing, which is particularly good for GPUs. So I think from an MI300 standpoint, we do believe that we will start ramping revenue in the fourth quarter with cloud AI customers and then it will be more meaningful in 2024.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the strong dynamics in Embedded, very diverse end markets. And given their strong market share position here, the Valens team is in a really good position to catalyze EPYC attach or Ryzen attached to their FPGA and adaptive compute solutions, right? I think embedded x86 is like a $6 billion to $8 billion per year market opportunity. So, Lisa, given you're a year with Xilinx in the portfolio, can you just give us an update on the synergy unlock and driving higher AMD compute attached to Xilinx sockets?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks, Harlan. It's a great question. The Xilinx portfolio has done extremely well with us. Very strong, I would say, we continue to get more content attached to the FPGAs and the adaptive SoCs. We have seen the beginnings of good traction with the cross-selling and that is opportunity to take both Ryzen and EPYC CPUs into the broader embedded market. I think the customers are very open to that. I think we have a sales force and a go-to-market capability across this customer set that is very helpful for that. So I do believe that this is a long-term opportunity for us to continue to grow our embedded business. And we've already seen some design wins as a result of the the combination of the Xilinx portfolio and the AMD portfolio, and I think we'll see a lot more of that going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And in terms of other opportunities, there appears to be this trend toward more of your cloud and hyperscale customers opting to do their own silicon solutions around accelerated compute or AI offload ends, right? And if I look at it right, there are less than a handful of the world semiconductor companies that have the compute, graphics, connectivity IP portfolio that you guys have as well as the capabilities to design these very complex offload SoCs, right? Does the team have a strategy to try and go after some of the semi-custom or full-blown ASIC-based hyperscale programs?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- We do, Harlan, and I would put it more broadly. And the more -- the broader point is, I think we have a very complete IP portfolio across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, DPUs, and a very capable semi-custom team. And so beyond hyperscalers, I think when we look at sort of higher volume opportunities, we think there are higher volume opportunities beyond game consoles that there are custom opportunities available. So I think that combination of IP is very helpful. I think it's a long-term opportunity for us, and it's one of the areas where we think we can add value to our largest customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I just want to talk about the pricing environment in a general sense. You guys have done a great job of increasing the benefits to your customers and being able to raise prices, pass along cost increases, those sorts of things. But the competitive intensity and the weakness in the market, at least currently seems to -- that it could work against that. So in the near term and then perhaps exiting this year into the next couple of years, can you just talk about where you think pricing is going to go across both your Data Center market, most importantly, but then also in your Client market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Ross, what I would say is a couple of things. I think in the Data Center market, the pricing is relatively stable. And what that comes from is -- our goal is to add more capability, right? So it's a TCO equation where as we're going from Milan to Genoa, we are adding more cores, more performance. And the performance per dollar that we offer to our customers is one where it's advantageous for them to adopt our technologies and our solutions. So I expect that. I think in the Client business, given some of the inventory conditions in there, I think there's -- it's a more competitive environment. We're all -- from my standpoint, we're focused on normalizing the inventory levels. And with that normalization, the most important thing is to ensure that we get the shipments more in line with consumption because I think that's a healthier business environment overall. And then, again, it's back to product values, right? So we have to ensure that our products continue to offer superior performance per dollar, performance per watt capabilities in the market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

I just wanted to know what you would describe as your competitive advantages? Everybody knows that's a market that's exploding right now. There's tons of demand. You guys have all the IP to be able to attack it. But there's a very large incumbent in that space as well. So when you think about what AMD can bring to the market, whether it's hardware, software, heterogeneity of the products you can bring, etc., what do you think is the core competitive advantage that can allow you to penetrate that market successfully?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,34,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. There's a couple of aspects, Ross. And -- yes, since we haven't yet announced MI300, all of the specifications will -- some of those will come over the coming quarters. MI300 is the first solution that has both the CPU and GPU together, and that has been very positive for the supercomputing market. I think as it relates to generative AI, and we think we have a very strong value proposition from both a hardware and again, it's a performance per dollar conversation, I think there's a lot of demand in the market. And there's also -- I think given our deep customer relationships on the EPYC side, there's actually a lot of synergy between the customer set between the EPYC CPUs and the sort of 300 GPU customers. So I think when we look at all these together, our view is that demand is strong for AI. And I think our position is also very strong given there are very, very few products that can really satisfy these large language model sort of needs. And I think we feel confident that we can do that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,37,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Tim, I think the answer is yes. I think we have made significant progress even over the last year in terms of our software capabilities. And the way you should think about our AI portfolio is it's really a broad AI portfolio across client sort of edge as well as cloud. And with that, I think the Xilinx team brings a lot of background and capability, especially in inference. We've added significant talent in our AI software as well. And the beauty of particularly the cloud opportunity is it's not that many customers, and it's not that many workloads. So when you have sort of very clear customer targets, we're working very, very closely with our customers on optimizing for a handful of workloads that generate significant volume. That gives us a very clear target for what winning is in the market. So we feel good about our opportunities in AI. And I'd like to say that it's a multiyear journey.

If I look at just your report versus what Intel reported on a Q-over-Q basis, it clearly on a year-over-year basis, you have gained share.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,56,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Stacy. That's a good question. The way to think about it is if you look at our Q1 gross margins and the Q2 guide around 50%. And as you know, both our Data Center and Embedded have a very strong gross margin performance. And so what the headwinds that impact our gross margin is really PC client on the side, which, as we talked about, is we are shipping significantly under the consumption and also to digest inventory in the downstream supply chain. As you know, typically, that's the time you get a significant pressure on the ASP side and on the funding side, that's why our gross margin in the Client segment has been challenged. In second half, we know it's going to be normalized. That's very important fact is when you normalize the demand and the supply, and we continue to plan a very competitive environment, so don't get us wrong on that front. But it will be better because you are not digesting the inventory, the channel funding, everything, those kind of price reduction will be much less. So we do think the second half will side, the gross margin will be better than first half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business.

And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it.

That's a good question. I think when you look at the year over year, you're absolutely right. Revenue is largely flattish, but operating margin dropped significantly. There are two major drivers. The first is we have increased the investment significantly, especially in networking and AI. As you may recall, we closed the Pensando last May or June. So this is the full quarter for Pensando expenses versus last year. Plus we also increased GPU investment under AI investment. That's all under the Data Center bucket. Secondly, I mentioned about product mix. Lisa said year-over-year cloud sales grew double digits significantly and enterprise actually declined.

Thank you for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question. I wanted to ask you about your views on the inferencing market for generative AI 3+. Specifically, I wanted to ask because I think there's some cross currents going on. We're hearing that CPUs are the best way to do inferencing, but then we're hearing the timeliness of CPUs is not there as a function to be able to enable these kind of instances. So I was curious what you guys think. And then I had a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,70,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I think, Harsh, if you were saying -- I mean, I think today, inference is used a lot. CPUs are used a lot for inference. Now where the demand is highest right now is for generative AI and large language model inferencing, you need GPUs to have the horsepower to train sort of the most sophisticated model. So I think those are the two, as you say, crosscurrents. I think inference becomes a much more important workload just given the adoption rate of AI across the board. And I think we'll see that for smaller tasks on CPUs, but for the larger tasks on GPUs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

We're doing quite a bit of work with large customers on MI300. And what we're seeing is very positive results.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. First of all, congratulations, Jean. And congrats as well to Devinder. I mean, the last five years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember all the work you and your finance team did six or seven years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement. My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the data center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the data center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa fourth gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so, we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with data center. Also, on the embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so, we think that's also a grower for AMD. On the other side, our client and gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM. And then on the gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so, console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the data center and the embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the client and gaming and see how that plays out.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, three or four points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from embedded and data center. So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue? How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Maybe -- so on the overall margin, the way to think about our business, Matt, is -- and our margin is primarily driven by product mix. So as the embedded and data center businesses are -- grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with data center being lower sequentially, that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing. What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so, as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in data center, embedded and some normalization of the client business as well. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,5,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question. Thanks and best wishes to Devinder and Jean from my side as well. On the first one, Lisa, I think you mentioned some elevated inventory among your cloud customers. I was hoping you could give us some quantification of how elevated? Is it a one-quarter issue? Is it a two-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your Genoa ramp? Because I think coming into this year, the expectations where you could grow server sales by over 20%. Do you think that is still a possibility because I imagine you get some benefit from better general pricing. So just puts and takes of how we should think about your data center business through this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,6,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure, Vivek. So look, we remain very bullish about our data center business. I mean, I think the feedback that we've gotten on Genoa from our customer set is very strong. And as I said, the important thing is we are expanding workloads. In terms of where we believe the -- as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels. Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer. And then, in terms of overall growth, as I said, we're very bullish on the overall growth of our data center business and the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year. And as we go through the ramp in Genoa, we do have more content with the higher core count that should also help ASPs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,7,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. And then, on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is -- could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year on year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So maybe just to make sure that we're just correlating the numbers. So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming, if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for -- in 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under-shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible. In terms of do I think it's conserve -- I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter, we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs. I think second quarter -- first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We -- and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half. And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint. So we feel good about the product road map in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization. Most of the focus is on continuing to differentiate our products and working with our customers to offer sort of very strong platforms. Operator Thank you. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

Thanks for taking my questions. I noted that you said that gross margins would expand in the second half, but you didn't give us any color on how much they might expand. Can you give us any idea like first half to second half?

Thanks for taking my questions. Stacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our embedded and data center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half. We continue to have the growth of both embedded and data center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the client segment. So going into second half, the normalization of the client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

I think it depends a bit on what happens in the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all of our segments.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,13,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how data center and embedded should be growing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are undershipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the four businesses of the second half versus the first half? Do you think your data center plus embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half? Or I mean, could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our data center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly stronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves. I think for the embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong backlog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though, because we're coming off very strong growth already. And so, I think those are the puts and takes.

Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, the pushback that we often get is AMD is doing really well, gaining share, but you're gaining share in relatively mature markets. And when it comes to AI, you do have a strategy, but you really haven't shown the product set, if you will. You talked about how you have CPU, GPU, FPGA and Pensando, and you're shipping samples of MI300, I guess, later this quarter and potentially launching in the second half. At what point do we, as analysts and investors, start to see your AI strategy materialize in the P&L and your profitability, if you will.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. We believe that AI is a huge driver of compute growth. And given our portfolio, it should be a driver of our growth as well. I think if you think about the product sets that we are putting sort of AI content in, you should expect MI300, of course, on the GPU training side. We just launched Ryzen AI in our PC portfolio. You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio as well. So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps. In terms of when -- we've talked before about sort of our data center GPU ambitions and the opportunity there. We see it as a large opportunity. As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads. And we should expect that to be more of a meaningful contributor in 2024.

And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps -- you were over-earning in that business given the environment?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,18,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure. So I think on the client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the first half will certainly be lower. We expect some improvement in the second half. But in terms of overall margin, we expect that the client business will be below the corporate average, and that's how we're modeling the client business. Operator Thank you.

So Aaron, we started shipping Genoa in the third quarter that ramped into the fourth quarter and will continue to ramp through 2024. The way I think about -- or the way you should think about the Genoa ramp is that it is a new platform for our customers. So they'll be introducing it -- introducing first-in-cloud sort of internal workloads and then going to external workloads and then enterprise. So I think it will be throughout 2024. We have -- I'm sorry, throughout 2023. We do have higher core counts on Genoa. So you would expect that that will give us some ASP uplift as we go through to some of those higher core count products. Bergamo will launch in the first half of the year. We are on track for the Bergamo launch, and you'll see that become a larger contributor in the second half. So as we think about the Zen 4 ramp and the crossover to our Zen 3 ramp, it should be toward the end of the year, sort of in the fourth quarter, that you would see a crossover of sort of Zen 4 versus Zen 3, if that helps you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then, as a quick follow-up, the business doesn't really ask that much about, but it's been doing phenomenally well here these last couple of quarters. It's actually the Xilinx business. I know it's within the embedded largely. But your self reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx. I think your competitor also growing a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Aaron, that business has done very well. So the Xilinx business, I think our overall embedded business continues to do well. When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and healthcare, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business. I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy. We have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter. As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there. But overall, I think the key point is the content, and our design win momentum is good, and we continue to ramp new design wins in the Xilinx business. Operator Thank you.

I wonder if you could talk to us about the puts and takes of PC market share in a down 10% environment. I would assume it helps you with consumers better than commercial, but what is your progress in terms of penetrating the notebook market and penetrating the commercial market where you could continue to gain share?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,24,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Joe, we view that the opportunity -- so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial, as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite -- a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there. I will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest in sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then, going back to the Genoa question that was asked a second ago, as you are in this kind of budget conscious environment, you're introducing a chip in a system that has pretty high platform cost. Does that slow the adoption at all? It seems like people -- and your competitors dealing with some of the same issues. Just how does the current environment affect the rate at which Genoa will ramp?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,26,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I would say, Joe, the total cost of ownership benefit of Genoa, particularly in some of the larger cloud workloads, is very, very significant. So I wouldn't say that that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms. So I would say that that ramp was a bit faster. But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have -- we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so, I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned toward the fourth quarter of 2023. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.

Let me ask a question. And Jean, congrats on the new job. Lisa, I was hoping you could give a little bit of sequential color to just size the magnitude of the three segments that are going down in the first quarter and then embedded going up. And really what I'm getting at there is, in an answer to a prior question, you talked about the mix being a headwind to gross margin. And I think, Jean, you cited data center dropping as a percent of the mix. So just trying to get the magnitude of just how much data center has to drop to make that outcome on the mix side be true.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,28,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ross. So let's see. We said the client and gaming segments would be seasonal. So you would expect that the data center would be more than seasonal. So maybe to help you size that, think about the data center sequential drop as double digit, whereas the client and the gaming segments are more like single digit, if that helps.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,31,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. Sorry for the nitpicky question. A bigger picture one for you then, Lisa, on competitive intensity. On one hand, I could see that the total cost of ownership benefits of these products, multicore, better performance, etc., could lead to higher ASPs, whether you're talking about the data center side or your client business. On the other side, competitive intensity and overall demand is weaker. And at some point, you might even get deflationary costs on the foundry side of things. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment given those somewhat contradictory pressures?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So maybe let me separate data center and client because they're a little bit different. I think on the data center side, we would -- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of fourth gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers. I think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so, there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing environment. I view that that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes. And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expect that to normalize too as everyone is sort of optimizing their capex spending.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question and congrats to Jean on the new seat. Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side. Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under consumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1? And Lisa, correct me if I am wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client but just to grow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think is the bottom on the PC? And then, I had a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,35,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Mark. So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our PC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half. In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance single-digit down. And then, we'll be back to a more normal environment. Now, just as a reminder though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we would expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

That's very helpful. And then, a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I guess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out? And could you remind us is, to the extent that you can help us understand the risk to the supply side for you in the event that the COVID spreads rapidly as they lift the restrictions and impacts what you have on the supply side there.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that we have a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit from a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean, we've seen, certainly in our data center business, we saw in the second half of the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China data center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery, I think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put that in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

And as my follow-up on your PC client business. So it had its correction a little bit later than some of the other folks in the semi industry and was obviously a little bit steeper. Can you talk about why that happened and why we should or should not expect that?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,42,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I guess, Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly -- coming off the pandemic, there was very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environment post pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the data center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted toward cloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the data center is our workloads are expanding. And so, we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so, I think that gives us good confidence. And frankly, the data center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important long-term driver is definitely there. So we feel good about sort of where we're positioned. Operator Thank you.

So let me make a couple of points. I think all of us, as we participate in the PC industry, there are various parts of the ecosystem that we work with. We work with our OEMs, we work with our retail partners, we work with our distribution and channel partners. And we're all working together to work through sort of the elevated inventory levels. As I said, I think we've made good progress on that. And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces. As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is -- particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average. That's different than our previous modeling. So previously, client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the -- I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so, with our data center, embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think client continues to be a good market overall.
