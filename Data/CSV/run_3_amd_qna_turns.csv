I guess I'll just ask it right out of the gate is, as we think about the GPU business, and I appreciate you talked about delivering north of $5 billion of revenue, which is extremely impressive in 2024. I'm curious if you -- how we should think about framing the GPU, the instinct business, as we think about 2025? And any kind of color you can provide us as far as kind of the progression of revenue, the pace of revenue first half versus second half as we think about some of the product cycle dynamics. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, first of all, look we were very pleased with how we finished 2024 in terms of the data center GPU business. I think the ramp was steep as we went throughout the year, and the team executed well. Going into 2025, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks, we are actually very happy with the progress that we're making on both the hardware road maps and the software road maps. So, on the hardware side, we launched MI325 at the end of the fourth quarter, started shipments then. We have new designs that have come on both MI300 and MI325 that we'll deploy in the first half of the year. And then the big news is on the MI350 series. So, we had previously stated that we thought we would launch that in the second half of the year. And frankly, that bring-up has come up better than we expected, and there is very strong customer demand for that. So, we are actually going to pull that production ramp into the middle of the year, which improves our relative competitiveness. So, as it relates to how data center -- so the overall data center business will grow strong double digits certainly, both the server product line as well as the data center GPU product line will grow strong double digits. And from the shape of the revenue you would expect that the second half would be stronger than the first half, just given MI350 will be a catalyst for the data center GPU business. But overall, I think we are very pleased with the trajectory of the data center business in both 2024 and then going into full year 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And as a quick follow-up, just thinking about the guidance overall relative to that down 7% sequential I know you mentioned seasonality across the business segments. Are you assuming that you are down sequentially in data center in total in 1Q? And how do I frame that relative to seasonality? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Aaron. So, let me give you some more color on the Q1 guide. So, Q1 guide was down 7% sequentially, as Jean mentioned. And the way that breaks out in each of the segments assume that data center would be down just about that average, so the corporate average. We would expect the client business and the embedded business to be down more than that. Just given where seasonality is for those businesses. And then we would expect gaming business will be down a little less than that. And that's a little atypical from a seasonality standpoint, but we are coming off of a year when there was a lot of let's call it, inventory normalization. And now that inventory has normalized, we would expect that that would be down a little bit less than the corporate average. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

I wanted to ask about the server CPU business. Jean, I think you have said in the past that core count is going to grow mid- to high teens. And as long as your competitor is not super aggressive on pricing that your business should grow roughly that much as well. Are you expecting or are you already seeing them become a little more aggressive on pricing as they attempt to shore up their share? It sounds like they're getting a bit more aggressive on pricing. So, wondering if you still think that the server CPU business can grow in line with that core kind of mid- to high teens.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think the way to look at our Q4 performance is our data center business overall did really well. It actually is consistent with our expectations. Of course, when we look at the server and the data center GPU, server did better than data center GPU.

Maybe I'll just add, Tim, on your question as to what you would expect as we go into 2025. I think you should assume that the first half of 2025 data center segment will be consistent with the second half of '24.

Lisa, a few questions on the data center GPU business. I think last year, AMD was very explicit about setting and beating or meeting expectations. This year, you have not set a specific forecast, and I'm curious what has changed. And then if I go back to your Analyst Day in December, I think at that time, you are sort of long-term 60% CAGR. Is it fair to assume that you can grow at that for '25, right, versus the $5 billion-plus that you did last year? So, just contrast the two years and then whether AMD can grow at that 60% trend line.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,11,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, Vivek, thanks for the question. I think what we look at is certainly for the first year of the data center GPU business, we wanted to give some clear progression as it was going. The business is now at scale, actually now at over $5 billion. And as we go into 2025, I think our guidance will be more at the segment level with some color as to some qualitative color as to what's going on between the two businesses. And relative to your question about long-term growth rates, you are absolutely right. I mean, I believe that the demand for AI compute is strong. And we've talked about a data center accelerator TAM upwards of $500 billion by the time we get out to 2028. I think all of the recent data points would suggest that there is a strong demand out there. Without guiding for a specific number in 2025, one of the comments that we made is we see this business growing to tens of billions, as we go through the next couple of years. And that gives you a view of the confidence that we have in the business and particularly our road map is getting stronger with each generation, right? So MI300 was a great start. MI350 series is stronger and addresses a broader set of workloads including both inference as well as training. And then as we get into MI400 series, we see significant traction and excitement around what we can do there with rackscale designs and address the innovation that's going on there. So, yes, we are bullish on the long term, and we'll certainly give you progress as we go through each quarter in 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, I would love your perspective on the news from DeepSeek recently, right? And there are kind of two parts to that. One is once you heard the news, do you think that should make us more confident or more conservative about the semiconductor opportunity going forward? Like is there something so disruptive in what they have done, that reduces the overall market opportunity? And then within that, have your views about GPU versus ASIC how that share develops over the next few years? Have those evolved in any way at all? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,13,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Great. Thanks for the question, Vivek. Yes, it's been a pretty exciting first few weeks of the year. I think the DeepSeek announcements, Allen Institute as well as some of the Stargate announcements, talk about just how much the rate and pace of innovation that's happening in the AI world. So, specifically relative to DeepSeek, look, we think that innovation on the models and the algorithms is good for AI adoption. The fact that there are new ways to bring about training and inference capabilities with less infrastructure actually is a good thing because it allows us to continue to deploy AI compute and broader application space and more adoption. I think from our standpoint, we also like very much the fact that – we are big believers in open source. And from that standpoint, having open-source models, looking at the rate and pace of adoption there, I think is pretty amazing. And that is how we expect things to go. So, to the overall question of how should we feel about it, I mean, we feel bullish about the overall cycle. And similarly, on some of the infrastructure investments that were announced with open AI and Stargate and building out, let's call it, massive infrastructure for next-generation AI. I think all of those say that AI is certainly on the very steep part of the curve. And as a result, we should expect a lot more innovation. And then on the ASIC point, let me address that because I think that is also a place where there is a good amount of discussion. I've always been a believer in you need the right compute for the right workload. And so, with AI, given the diversity of workloads, large models, media models, small models, training, inference when you are talking about broad foundational models or very specific models, you're going to need all types of compute. And that includes CPUs, GPUs, ASICs, and FPGAs. Relative to our $500 billion-plus TAM going out in time, we've always had ASIC as a piece of that. But my belief is, given how much change there is still going on in AI algorithms that ASICs will still be the smaller part of that TAM because it is a more, call it, specific workload-optimized, whereas GPUs will enable significant programmability and adjustments to all of these algorithm changes. But when I look at the AMD portfolio, it really is across all of those pieces. So, CPUs, GPUs. And we are also involved in a number of ASIC conversations, as well as customers want to really have an overall compute partner.

Thanks for taking my question. Obviously, it was good to see MI355X pulled into midyear. But I wanted to clarify, you said first half '25 data center GPU likely consistent with second half '24, and I was wondering if you could speak to whether or not the shape of the first half changed over the last few months and is potentially related to this pulled in timeline, it could be a potential air pocket ahead of that launch, or this was sort of consistent with how you saw things playing out as MI350 and MI325X ramps more fully?

Thanks for the question, Joshua. No, I would say from our standpoint, we've gotten incrementally more positive on the 2025 data center GPU ramp. I think MI350 series was in second half always, but pulling it into midyear is an incremental positive. And from a first-half, second-half statement, as I mentioned, we have some new important AI design wins that are going to be deployed with and MI300 and MI325 in the first half of the year. But with MI350 series, we end up with more content. I mean, it is a more powerful GPU, ASPs go up, and you would expect larger deployments that include training and inference in that time frame. So, the shape is similar to what we would have expected before.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

And believe it or not, I could ask a question on client. Obviously, the growth number in the fourth quarter, I mean, it was certainly higher than our model. Could you clarify the drivers of the strength across desktop, notebook, and enterprise and how we should think about 1Q, and in particular, to put it bluntly, I mean, are you worried at all about inventory buildup given how much your client revenue has outperformed the broader PC market in the second half of the year?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,17,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks for the question. Our client business performed really well throughout 2024 and Q4 was a very strong quarter. There are a couple of reasons for that. So, we should go through that. We don't believe there is some substantial inventory buildup. We actually think that what we're seeing is very strong adoption of our new products. So, on the desktop side, we saw our highest sell-out in many years, as we went through the holiday season, launching our new gaming CPUs, frankly, they have been constrained in the market, and we've continued shipping very strongly through the month of January as we are catching up with some demand there. So, desktop business was very strong. And on the notebook side, we also saw a number of our OEM partners launching new AI PCs with the slew of new bulk mobile part numbers that we announced at CES. We have our strongest PC portfolio on the mobile side with top-to-bottom Copilot+ PC-compatible products, and those are playing very well into the market. So, I think Q4 was strong. I know that there was some commentary about whether there were pull-ins relative to tariffs. We didn't see that in the fourth quarter. I think, as I said, we saw strong sellout. Going into the first quarter, we do expect seasonality in there. But the part of our business that is performing better than seasonality is the desktop portion of the business. And the mobile portion of the business is, let's call it, more typical seasonality. But overall, I think we are very bullish on our prospects to grow clients in 2025. Just given all of the drivers from product portfolio to some of the market dynamics, as well as our new commercial PCs portfolio.

Thanks for taking my question. For the fourth quarter, did your overall server CPU business grow double digits sequentially? And as a follow-on to that, I think Q4 was the sixth consecutive quarter of double-digit year-over-year increases for your on-prem service solutions. On a sequential basis, I know you guys did start to see recovery in enterprise in the second quarter of last year, I think it was strongly up sequentially in the third quarter, a pretty broad base. Did enterprise service grow sequentially in Q4? And Lisa, how do you see the share prospects in this segment as you step into 2025?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,19,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Harlan, thanks for the question. So, I think as Jean mentioned earlier, so in the fourth quarter, we did see a sequential double-digit growth in our server business. We saw that in both cloud and enterprise. I think the server business has been performing extremely well. We are continuing to grow our cloud footprint with more workloads, as we have the strength of the churn portfolio in addition to Genoa and Milan. And then to your question on enterprise, I do believe we are seeing some strong traction in the enterprise. I think what's helping us there is, frankly, we've invested a lot more in go-to-market and the go-to-market investments are paying off. The enterprise sales cycle is often a six-month to nine-month sales cycle. But as we've invested more resources in it throughout 2024, we've seen that convert into a significant number of new POCs that are now converting into volume deployments. And as we go through into 2025, from a competitiveness standpoint, we have a very strong portfolio across every price point, every core count, every workload. So, I think, we see a strong 2025 for server CPUs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Networking is a very critical part of the AI infrastructure becoming even more important. There seems to be this misconception that AMD is behind the curve here, you're keeping pace kind of leveraging the incumbent Ethernet technology, strong installed ecosystem. You guys are spearheading the UltraNET Ethernet Consortium. You've got your Infinity Fabric technology for scale-up connectivity. So, as you continue to drive customer adoption of your overall AI platforms, what's the feedback been like on your AI networking architectures? And any networking-related innovations the team is going to be bringing to the market this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,21,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Harlan, for that question. No question. Networking is an extremely important part of the AI solution, and it's an area that we have been investing and spending quite a bit of effort with our customers and our partners jointly. The way to think about it is that our networking proof points are actually increasing as we are going from MI300 to MI325 to MI350 to MI400. So, in each of those points, we are increasing with a number of proof points. I think people want to see more clusters of ours. Certainly, on inference, we've shown great performance and total cost of ownership.We now also have a number of training systems that we are putting on board. And the important part there is the networking. We have worked very closely with our partners on Ethernet. We believe that this is the right technology for the future. In addition to third-party networking solutions, we are also with our Pensando team developing our own in-house AI NIC that Forrest mentioned at our Q4 advancing AI event. And as we look forward, working with our customers, we are actually standing up full rack solutions at both the MI350 level as well as in the MI400 series. So, I think the net of it is we believe that, yes, it is absolutely very important. And in addition to all of the hardware and software work, the system-level scaling is super important, and we are on track to deliver that with our road map.

Lisa, I just want to follow up the data center GPU business, obviously, very strongly year over year, but it seems for your commentary kind of the sequential growth kind of slows for the next kind of three quarters. So, I just want to understand the why. Obviously, you have some new products coming. So, maybe it's just the shift to the new products. I also want to just ping your brain on in terms of when you look at the ASIC storylines, there tends to be kind of a shift to focus on training versus inference. So, just your perspective, I know a lot of your workloads initially were inference. Are you seeing any shift in terms of the demand from your customers between training inference as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 5, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,23,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Blayne. Look, the way I would say it is, we saw tremendous growth as we build up the data center GPU business throughout 2024. So, I think what we're seeing is we are continuing to do new deployments. We're continuing to bring on new customers. Clearly, we are going through a little bit of a product transition time frame in the first half of the year. But the key is bringing in the MI350 series was very, very important for us and for the customer set. So, the fact that that hardware has come on clean. And we've learned a lot from the initial deployments of MI300, I think, is very positive. And this is as we might expect, given the overall landscape of deployments. And then to the second part of your question, as it relates to ASICs, I really haven't seen a big shift at all in the conversation. I will say that the conversation as it relates to AMD, is kind of the following. People like the work that we've done in inference. But certainly, our customers want to see us as a strong training solution. And that's consistent with what we've said, right? We've said that we have like a stepwise road map to really show each one of those solutions. On the software side, we've invested significantly more in some of those sort of the trading libraries. We talked -- Harlan's question earlier about networking. And then this is about just getting into data centers and ramping up tens of thousands of GPUs. So, from my standpoint, I think we are making very good progress there. And I just want to reiterate on the ASIC side, look, I think ASICs are a part of the solution, but there -- I want to remind everyone, they are also a very strong part of the AMD sort of toolbox. So, we've done semi-custom solutions for a long time. We are very involved in a number of ASIC discussions with our customers as well. And what they like to do is, they'd like to take our baseline IP and really innovate on top of that. And that's what I think differentiates our capability is that we do have all of the building blocks of CPUs, GPUs, as well as all of the networking technologies that you would need to put the solutions together.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

I want to ask this a little more explicitly. So, you said your server business was up strong double digits sequentially in Q4. My math suggests that could have even meant that the GPU business was down sequentially. And given your guidance for I guess, flattish GPUs in the first half of '25 versus second half of '24. Again, does the math not suggest that you'd be down sequentially both in Q1 and in Q2 to feel like -- am I doing something wrong with my math?

Perhaps, Stacy, maybe let me help give you a little bit of color there. I don't think we said strong double-digits. I think we said double digits. So, that perhaps is the -- so data center segment was up 9% sequentially. Server was a bit more than that. Data center GPU was a little less than that. I think for some of the models that are out there, you might be a little bit light in the Q3 data center GPU number. So, there might be some adjustments that need to be done there. But I think your suggestion would be incorrect. We -- if you just take the halves, second half '24 to first half '25, let's call it roughly flattish, plus or minus.

Thank you so much for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question on the server CPU business. I'm curious how you're thinking about the market this year. And if you can delineate between cloud and enterprise, that would be really helpful. And then kind of part B to that question. In your prepared remarks, you talked about you all having more than 50% share across the major hyperscalers. How would you characterize the competitive intensity at those customers vis-a-vis some of the internal custom silicon that's expected to ramp over the coming quarters and years?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Toshiya. So, let me say, as we look into 2025, I think we see a good server market between cloud and enterprise. I think as we went into sort of the early part of '24, there was a little bit of, let's call it, less investments on the CPU side as people were optimizing investments for AI. We saw that sort of pick up in the second half of the year in '24, and we would expect that to go into '25. So, the enterprise refresh cycles are coming in again. And certainly, there are a number of cloud vendors that are now, let's call it, reupdating some of their data centers. And then your second question was as it relates to what?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

Look, I think it's about the same. What I would say, Toshiya is, it is less about custom silicon versus x86. It is much more about do you have the right product for the right workload. And look, the server market is always a competitive market. What we've done, and you've seen it in our Zen 4 product line as well as in our Zen 5 product line. We've expanded the design points for each of the core generation so that we have cloud-native and then we have enterprise-optimized low core count, high core count, highest performance, best perf per dollar. And I think as we do those things, I think we're continuing to grow share across both cloud and enterprise. And look, it is always very competitive. We take every design win very seriously, but we are winning our fair share. And I think that's the strength of the product portfolio.

And then as a quick follow-up, maybe one for Jean. So, you're guiding gross margin to 54% in the first quarter. I'm curious what some of the major puts and takes are and those are the things that we should be cognizant of going into Q2 and more importantly, the second half. Given your data center commentary skewed more to the second half, I would expect margins to improve in the second half.

Thanks for the question. You are right. Our gross margin is primarily driven by our revenue mix, I think when you look at looking to 2025, Q1 guide, not only data center continued to grow significantly year over year. At the same time, client business is also growing year over year. So, overall, the revenue mix is quite consistent with the Q4. So, the gross margin guide is 54%. I think for the first half, if the revenue mix is at this level, we do feel the gross margin will be consistent with 54%. But going into second half, we do believe the data center is our fastest growth driver for the company and that will drive the gross margin to step up in second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/05/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2024-earnings-call-t/

My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. Lisa, you took up your '24 outlook by $500 million. Curious what drove the change there? And more importantly, as you look forward into calendar '25, I doubt you're going to give us quantitative guidance on this call. But conceptually, how are you thinking about growth in your Instinct between your large cloud customers and your enterprise customers? And if you can speak to the possibility of adding new customers within cloud, again, specific to Instinct, that would be really helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,2,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Toshiya, thank you for the question. So first of all, we had a very strong quarter for the Data Center overall in Q3 and especially for the Instinct product portfolio. We actually completed some important customer milestones, and we were able to ramp a bit above our initial expectations. So Data Center GPU was very strong in the third quarter, and we raised overall guidance for the year from exceeding $4.5 billion to exceeding $5 billion based on the completion of some of those customer milestones. So we feel good about the trajectory as we go through the end of this year. And then to your overall question about 2025. At a high level, look, we feel very good about the market from everything that we see, talking to customers, there's significant investment in trying to build out the infrastructure required across all of the AI workloads. And then within that, our product portfolio is getting stronger with the annual cadence, launching 325 later this quarter and 355 in the second half of next year. And then in terms of customers, our customer engagements are actually broadening quite well. So -- and it's broadening in 2 ways. So certainly, cloud -- our largest cloud customers are broadening the set of workloads that they're running on AMD Instinct. And we're also very engaged with a number of large cloud and enterprise customers that are actively working with us and optimizing their workloads, and we would expect those would be good opportunities for us over the next couple of quarters as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then a quick follow-up, maybe one for Jean on gross margin. You're guiding Q4 gross margin essentially flat sequentially, if you can walk through the puts and takes there, that would be really helpful. And then again, as you look forward into '25, you're kind of speaking to continued Data Center growth. One would think the Embedded business hopefully begins to recover. And then within some of your businesses like server CPU, I would expect enterprise to grow perhaps faster off a low base. So I do think you have a lot going for you from a gross margin standpoint. But are those points valid? And what should we be thinking about in terms of potential headwinds as well? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,4,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yes. Thank you for that question. First, we are very pleased with our Q3 gross margin performance. We delivered 53.6% and we are guiding approximately 54% in Q4. In general, when you look at 2024, our gross margin improvement has been primarily driven by the mix, especially Data Center business continue to be the strong growth driver of our business, it's accounting for more than 50% of our revenue mix, that helps us to improve gross margin. Going to 2025, we're not going to guide specifically. But as you mentioned, there are puts and takes that will help us going forward I would say first is, going forward, the largest growth driver is our Data Center business, both the CPU side, the GPU side, and you are absolutely right, we see our Enterprise Server business continue to expand. That will be a tailwind on gross margin side. And secondly, Embedded business is recovering and gradually, but that will also help us with our gross margin. At the same time, we are also seeing our Client business expansion nicely. Client business today is more focused on consumer side, which tend to be below corporate average. That's something headwind we'll deal with. And lastly, I would say our team has done a great job to continue to improve operational efficiency. When we scale the company next year, you can see we're going to benefit from economies of scale to continue to drive our operational efficiency to improve gross margin. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

I guess maybe building on the latter point that you just made, I'm curious of how you would characterize your supply chain having evolved now talking about $5-plus billion. How do we think about what you've been doing on the supply side, given the lead times, the production cycles of these MI300 and MI325 GPUs as we look out into 2025.

So look, I've been very happy with how our supply chain has ramped over the last number of quarters. Clearly, it's a tight supply environment, but we've done a great job getting -- ensuring that we have capacity across the entire supply chain. Again, that was part of the reason for the higher revenue in the third quarter around our Instinct business, just both customer demand as well supply chain improvement. And going into the next few quarters going into 2025, I think we expect that the environment will continue to be tight, but we've also planned for significant growth going into 2025. And so we feel good about our overall supply chain capability.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then as a quick follow-up, when I look at the sequential guidance in revenue at the midpoint, let's call it about $680 million up sequentially. Could you help us frame how much of that is driven by Client versus the Data Center piece of the business? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

So certainly, if you look at the sequential guide, the largest contributor is the Data Center business. And that is now such a large piece of our business, it's over 50% of our business in Q3, and it will continue to grow in Q4. Client segment, we also expect to perform well. I think we've done very well with our launches this year, both on the desktop Zen 5 launches as well as the notebook AIPC launches. So we expect growth there. And then the other segments on a sequential basis, Gaming, Embedded would be more modest. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

Jean, when you gave the segment guidance kind of playing off the last question, you didn't mention Embedded as being up. And then, Lisa, you just talked about it being up left. Just curious, I know it's kind of a muted recovery. But what's happening in the Embedded business implied in your fourth quarter guidance? And how are you thinking about 2025 just directionally?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,10,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ross. Let me start, and then maybe Jean can add. Look, we've seen some improvement in the Embedded business. You saw some improvement in the sequential in Q3. We expect some modest improvement in Q4. What we're seeing is really a mix across the different subsegments in Embedded. There are some segments that are stronger. So our test and emulation business actually did very well. We're ramping our new Versal platform there. Aerospace and defense did well, also continues to be relatively strong. Communications has not seen much recovery. So I would say that, that's still fairly muted. And industrial is also a little bit on the softer side. So between all of those, we expect a little bit of growth into Q4, and let's call it, modest growth in 2025, but we're planning for it to be a little bit mixed among the segments, maybe, Jean, if you want to add?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And I guess for my follow-up, just on the EPYC business. You've done incredibly well there, Lisa. Have you seen any kind of loosening up of the crowding out effect with the -- well, in your case, the Instinct side taking demand away from the EPYC side. It doesn't seem to have slowed you down much this year. You're still up by my math, maybe 33% or so. And how are you thinking about that kind of CPU versus GPU dynamic from a customer spend perspective as we look into '25? and I have another quick one.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,13,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure. Let me talk a little bit about the Data Center CPU business. Look, we've been extremely pleased with the progress there. I think the market environment has certainly gotten better over the last couple of quarters. We've seen some of the large cloud customers now sort of adding to their data center capacity and refreshes. We've seen enterprises also start with some of their modernization activities. Within that sort of market environment, our product portfolio has done extremely well. here in the third quarter, the Zen 4 portfolio between Genoa and Bergamo was very strong. We saw the beginning ramp of our Zen 5 Turin capabilities. And then we also actually saw pretty good demand even on Zen 3 or our Milan family just given the performance of price ratios there. So overall, we have a very strong top to bottom stack, and we do see some strength in the overall server market, which adds to some of the AI opportunity that we have. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,14,Ben Reitzes,Melius Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes. If I could stick to the pattern of two. I want to follow up a little bit on servers and thanks for the question. Going to next year, it seems like you're poised for more share gains. And I was just wondering there is a perception that GPUs are cannibalizing the servers. But what are you seeing specifically in Turin? Is it -- with this momentum that you're talking about, is it the right CPU for a GPU are hyperscalers in particular liking the fact you can consolidate and create more room for AI gear. What is the particular catalyst that you're seeing out there with this upgrade?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,15,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ben. So I think when I look at Turin and the environment going into 2025, Turin is actually very well optimized for sort of the broad set of server workloads or traditional CPU workloads, including both scale-up and scale-out workloads. So I think that is very positive. We believe that there will be strong AI content on CPUs, and that helps Turin as well. It's also an important piece of the head node of any GPU configuration. So overall, I think those are all good catalyst for us. And primarily, we're at this point where we're expanding the workloads in general as we are working with our largest cloud customers, and we're making strong progress in enterprise, which has been very important for us. The enterprise sale takes longer. There's a significant amount of POC work and just making sure that CIOs are familiar with our offerings. But I think between our Zen 4, Zen 5 offerings now we really have a very broad portfolio that satisfies the vast majority of the traditional CPU workloads.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then I just want to follow up on the PC market. There's -- just you guys keep outperforming, but there's just general concerns that -- of consumer weakness. And I was just wondering what you're seeing in the 4Q and is there a risk of more than seasonal decline in the 1Q? Or do you feel like things will keep going unabated in the PC market for you guys, particularly?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,17,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, we see a few things in the PC market. So our business tends to be more consumer weighted. So the second half of the year is usually stronger than the first half of the year. And this year, that's added to the fact that we have a couple of product launches. So we launched our desktop products for -- with Zen 5 and our Ryzen 9000 series. And we also launched our AIPC next-generation Ryzen AI 300 products. So I think the combination of those 2 have given us, let's call it, a stronger than normal second half of the year. I would expect there will be seasonality going into the first half. That's typical in our business. I think the main point is, I mean, this is the strongest PC portfolio we've had sort of in our history, I think, across desktop and notebook. And as we go into 2025, I think there's generally some optimism about the PC market, let's call it, maybe growing mid-single digits. And within that, we have the AI PC catalyst as well as some of the Windows 10 sort of end of support coming in 2025 as catalysts. So I think we feel good about the PC market in 2025, but we would expect some level of seasonality going into the first half of the year.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,18,Joshua Buchalter,Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I'll keep it to 1 since I'm new here. On the Data Center GPU side, I realize everyone wants new customer announcements and 2025 guidance, but we're not going to get that, certainly not today. That maybe you could speak to how much of a runway you think exists at existing customers? And how much of a catalyst MI325X on CDNA3 and then MI355 on the new architecture can be to growing revenue and workload breadth internally and externally at these existing customers as we think about growth into next year at the Data Center GPU side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,19,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Joshua. Thanks for the question. So look, maybe let me start again with this notion of we're very pleased with the progress that we've made in the Data Center GPU business. I mean, if you think about when we started the year, we were just launching MI300. We had talked about perhaps $2 billion of revenue in 2024. And as we've gone through the last few quarters, what we've done is we've successfully completed a number of customer milestones. And those customer milestones include things like ensuring that we are at scale in data centers, meeting all of the reliability requirements and so on and so forth as well as optimizing on specific workloads and ensuring that we have very, very performant -- out-of-the-box performance. So I think we have gained a lot of confidence over the last couple of quarters, just seeing how the customers have ramped I know everyone would like it to go faster. We think it's actually going really well. And being able to talk about exceeding $5 billion of revenue in 2024, I think we feel really good about that. Going into 2025, we feel great about the market. The market continues to be the place where there's a significant capex investments. We feel great about our product portfolio. It is getting stronger with everything that we've learned off of the MI300 ramp. And then in particular, on the software side, we have greatly increased our customer support, customer engagements, out-of-box performance, open source ecosystem, all of those components that are necessary to ensure that customers can run at scale, at performance at a great TCO. So all those together, I think we have a good opportunity to grow at our current customers with the number of workloads. You heard Meta talking at our event about expanding from inference on their large language models with Llama 3.1 to some training workloads. Microsoft has also been a very, very great partner with that. And then you should assume that we are working with all the large customers out there, and many of them are very deep engagements with us to continue to optimize their software to our hardware. So those are the opportunities in front of us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

We actually did better in the Data Center GPU business relative to our initial expectations. So you would imagine that the business was actually greater than $1.5 billion. I mean we're actually seeing now our GPU business really approaching the scale of our CPU business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then just kind of more broadly on the shape of next year. I mean you see that the market with these big customers, how do you see the shape of revenue off of that CQ4 number? Can you continue to grow off that level? Or do you see some risk maybe of a pause next year? And I ask because MI355 is dropping into the existing infrastructure, and I think you did say you'll have a liquid cooled option, but you do hear about some customers wanting rack scale. So I wonder if you worry a bit about there could be a pause before you get to rack scale in 2026.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,24,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I guess I would put it like this. I mean, look, this business is -- there's a lot of activity going on, and we're spending time with customers as they're building out their data centers, some preferred air-cooled environments, liquid cooled environments, some want rack scale, some are perfectly happy to go into their existing data center infrastructure. So there are lots of different variants. What I would say about 2025 is we feel very good about the growth opportunities I would say that it might be lumpy. In general, these are large customer acquisitions and it's not always predictable exactly which quarters you would expect the significant build out. But I think overall, we feel good about the trajectory into 2025. I don't know if that's helpful. Operator The next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,25,Joe Moore,Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about the $5 billion of AI revenue, how that breaks down between training and inference, if you're able to assess that and just I know you sort of started off with most of the traction in inference, but you've seen some traction on the training side. Can you just talk about what that split looks like going forward as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,26,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Joe. So certainly, from the $5 billion that we're talking about, the early traction has been primarily with inference just given the strength of the product portfolio. MI300 is like very, very well optimized for inference given the memory capacity and memory bandwidth capabilities. But we have had some training adoption, and we expect that, that will continue to grow as we go through the next few quarters. And so as we -- let's call it fast forward a year, I would say we would have a fairly balanced portfolio between training and inference.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,27,Vivek Arya,Analyst,analyst,"-- I had two. So Lisa, for the first one, how do you address this investor argument that MI is off to a great start, but spec-wise, remains kind of 1 year behind the industry leader, right? You're shipping something comparable to Hopper while they are starting to ship Blackwell next year. When you are at MI350, they will be on Blackwell Ultra or Rubin. So how do you see AMD closing that gap? And can you really gain share until that gap is closed?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,28,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Vivek, I actually don't see that. So maybe let me state it in another way. I think MI300, when we launched it was behind H100, H100 was in the market for a much longer time. And we have with our accelerated road map actually closed a good part of that gap. I think MI325 is a great product. It's going to compete very well with H200 and the MI350 series will compete very well with Blackwell. In the overarching view of the world, frankly, the market continues to be constrained, particularly in the newer product generations. It takes a long time to go from, let's call it, shipping your first samples to actually ramping in volume production workloads. And I think one of the advantages that we have with the -- with our portfolio is that from a data center retrofit standpoint, it's actually a much easier ramp, just the infrastructure is the same. So look, there are lots of opportunities across the set of AI workloads. We think this road map is actually strengthening over time, and that's the feedback that we're getting from our customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,29,Vivek Arya,Analyst,analyst,"-- And for my follow-up, Lisa, back to the question on the PC market. So it was up -- or the client was up 26% sequentially. I think you are guiding to some growth in Q4 as well. How do you see the state of the channel? And I ask that just because sell-through in Q3 was not that great. And I think Intel had guided down their Q3 to be flat or down. So just how much of the growth that you are seeing is because of ASPs? How much of this is units? And as you look out to 2025, do you think the ASP strength that we have seen this year, can that mix benefit continue for you in '25 also?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,30,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Vivek, the way I would say it is our client business has a few factors that may be slightly different from the overall market. So let me start with our desktop channel. I think our share is very high in the desktop channel. And we've done very well there. So we saw strength across that portfolio in Q3. We actually saw some of our highest sell-through, so it was a strong sell-through quarter. And obviously, it shows in the revenue results. . I think on the notebook standpoint, our business tends to be more heavily consumer weighted and so that is more of a second half story. There is good momentum around AI PCs. I mean we've looked at some of the activation rates of our newest risen AI 300 processors and the activation rates are good. It's still very early in the AI PC cycle, but we are seeing some good momentum there. So I think we'll see both units up and the ASPs will depend a little bit on the mix between consumer and enterprise and desktop and notebooks. But my earlier comment about the Client segment, I think it is an opportunity for us. We are underrepresented in the Client segment. And we see an opportunity to grow both in consumer as well as enterprise. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,31,Harlan Sur,Analyst,analyst,"-- Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, on your core EPYC business, you did start to see recovery in enterprise last quarter. It was broad-based across many verticals. You've got -- you've also got a growing share dynamic as well, right? And it sounds like that trend continued in the September quarter. Do you anticipate continued follow-through in terms of quarter-on-quarter growth this quarter for enterprise? And then maybe what sort of enterprise and general cloud demand trends are you seeing out of China?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,32,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Harlan, thanks for the question. We did see positive growth momentum here in the third quarter in enterprise. We are getting broader adoption and we're seeing that growth both in on-prem deployments as well as cloud third-party deployments. And so we're very happy with sort of the adoption of our cloud instances when people are doing migrations, they're migrating from on-prem to cloud, they're migrating to AMD or they're migrating from older cloud instances to newer cloud instances. We're seeing migrations to AMD. So I think that helps us in both the Enterprise segment as well as the Cloud segment. As we go forward into the fourth quarter, I think we are expecting another quarter of growth on a sequential basis for our Server business and strength in both Enterprise and Cloud. And I think as we think about our opportunities going forward, the Enterprise business is a place where we have been underrepresented. I think our portfolio has strengthened. So the platforms that are being offered by the OEMs have broadened with not just Zen 4, but also with the Zen 5 portfolio launch. And so I think those are opportunities for us in 2025.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question. But the first one, I wanted to go back to what you said about the size of the Data Center GPUs in the quarter. You said it was approaching the size of Your compute business which you put around what under $1.7 billion, maybe a little more. Is that right? And like if that is right, it implies that at $5 billion for the year, you'd actually be down in Q4. So I'd probably got to be $5.2 billion or $5.3 billion for the full year, just to be flat sequentially and more than that to get growth. So I guess the question is number one, is that the size of the business that you're talking about in Q3? And is that the kind of level of growth you're thinking into Q4?

You have to remember that in our Data Center segment, we have some other revenue that is not CPUs and GPUs, right? We have some FPGAs and other things. But the question earlier was the revenue of $1.5 billion, and I said that it was greater than $1.5 billion. So take that as a fundamental. And then as -- we talked about -- we didn't guide an exact number for the data center GPU. We said exceed $5 billion.

For my follow-up, you talked a little bit about lumpiness next year, is there any kind of seasonality or something that I to be thinking about specifically into Q1 for Data Center GPU? I know you have like the MI300, I guess, ramping into production at that point. But should I be thinking about a seasonal -- like seasonality into Q1 given the general statement on lumpiness?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,37,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I wasn't implying something about seasonality of the Data Center GPU business. I was implying more that if you think about the evolution of the business, it depends quite a bit on a specific number of customers. So these are large customers that drive deployments. Like for example, the third quarter was a bit higher than we expected. That was driven by some additional customer demand, and we may see that type of lumpiness. So that was what I was implying. And we'll have to see how things evolve as we get into 2025. Operator We have time for two more questions. The next question comes from the line of Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,38,Harsh Kumar,Analyst,analyst,"-- Lisa, first of all, congratulations on your 10-year anniversary. I just looked at the 10-year chart, the stock is around $3, so a heck of a job here. And also congratulations on $5 billion in Instinct revenues. So I wanted to ask the first question. This is one we get from investors all the time. In the coming year, let's say, 2025, your key competitor will take most of the TAM of the AI market, the GPU market, rough count, they'll take in something like $50 billion, $60 billion, you'll get another $5 billion to $10 billion, call it. So the question is, what do you think is the major hindrance? You've got chip level compatibility. So does it boil down to the fact that you're just earlier in the game. You've been doing this just 12 months in a serious manner? Or is there still a rack level of disparity? If you could just help us think about what the hindrances are to you becoming a major player here.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,39,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Harsh. Thanks for the question and for the comments. Maybe let me say, I view them as opportunities. If you remember, Harsh, and I think you do, our EPYC ramp from Zen 1, Zen 2, Zen 3, Zen 4 we had extremely good product even back in the Rome days, but it does take time to ensure that there is trust built, there is familiarity with the product set. There are some differences, although we're both GPUs, there are some differences, obviously, in the software environment. And people want to get comfortable with the workload ramp. So from a ramp standpoint, I'm actually very positive on the ramp rate. It's the fastest product ramp that I've seen overall. And my view is this is a multi-generational journey. We've always said that. We feel very good about the progress I think next year is going to be about expanding both customer set as well as workload. And as we get into the MI400 series, we think it's an exceptional product. So -- all in all, the ramp is going well, and we will continue to earn and -- earn the trust and the partnership of these large customers. What I will say is customers are very, very open to AMD. And we see that everywhere we go, everyone is giving us a very fair shot at earning their business, and that's what we intend to do.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, from a follow-up, and maybe Jean can help out here. It's kind of well understood that your gross margin for MI300, MI325 will be below corporate margins. Could you help us maybe think of some framework on how those gross margins for Instinct might get to parity with your corporate business?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 29, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,41,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yes. We are very pleased with our overall revenue ramp of our Data Center GPU business, and our team not only support the revenue ramp and continue to improve the gross margin. Overall, it's below corporate average. And when you think about it going into next year, of course, our top priority right now is to really focus on to address customer demand and provide the TCO benefit really increase significantly our market presence and drive substantial revenue growth. On the gross margin side, once we continue to ramp the revenue, we do think we'll have the opportunity to continue to improve gross margin. When you think about it, this is the data center business, over the -- in the longer run, longer term, it tends to be better than corporate average. We'll take some time to get there. But when you look at our Data Center segment performance, we more than doubled the revenue year-over-year, but we tripled the operating income year-over-year. So I think that's how we are thinking about it is really to drive the long-term growth and get the market presence at the same time, drive gross margin up.

Lisa, I just wanted to ask on mix the MI300 platform into Q4. Obviously, you're launching the MI325 series. Should you say -- should we expect a significant contribution the new product in Q4? Or is this a situation in which it's launching late year and most of the impact is into Q1? I guess that's the first one. And then the second one is just if you look into next year, could you talk about where the end markets are and Embedded for Xilinx? You gave some color on comm and a little of industrial there. But just where we're at in terms of starting kind of Q4 and into Q1. Are there any that are outperforming, underperforming?

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Absolutely, Tom. So back to your first question in terms of the mix in Q4. We would expect the majority of the mix will still be on MI300. MI325 is going into production late in the quarter, and it will be more of a first quarter ramp. So that's that question. And then in terms of the Embedded business going to 2025, I would say that the trends that we see are similar to what I mentioned for the Q3, Q4 timing. We do expect that we're -- some of the markets will recover, we're expecting that it will be a gradual recovery. So we see that. And the strength that we see is in some of the Test and Emulation segment, we see some strength, certainly in aerospace and defense. There was a little bit of recovery in automotive that we started to see. We're still waiting for comms and industrial. So we'll get more visibility on that as we go through sort of the end of this year, but that's what we see currently.

Lisa, I wanted to ask you about MI300, how you see it playing out sequentially for the rest of the year. I guess there's about $2.8 billion left to hit your annual target. So, I'm wondering if you see things picking up in the fourth quarter and how that's going sequentially. And if you don't mind, I wanted to also ask about next year if you see potential for rapid growth. You're probably aware of some of the chatter out there, and I just was wondering if you're already seeing signs that you can grow significantly, given your road map for next year.

Thanks for the question. So, first of all, on sort of MI300 and the customer evolution, we're very happy with how MI300 has progressed. When we started the year, I think the key point for us was to get our products into our customers' data centers, to have them qualify their workloads, to really ramp in production, and then see what the production capabilities are, especially performance and all of those things. And I can say now being sort of more than halfway through the year, we've seen great progress across the board. As we look into the second half of the year, I think we would expect that MI300 revenue would continue to ramp in the third quarter and the fourth quarter. And we're continuing to expand both current deployments with our existing customers, as well as we have a large pipeline of customers that we're working through that are getting familiar with our architecture and software and all that stuff. So, I would say overall, very pleased with the progress, and really continuing right on track to what we expected from the capabilities of the product. As we go into next year, I mean, one of the important things that we announced at Computex was increasing and expanding our road map. I think we feel really good about our road map. We're on track to launch MI325 later this year, and then next year, our MI350 Series, which will be very competitive with Blackwell solutions. And then we're well on our way to our CDNA Next as well. So, I think, overall, we remain quite bullish on the overall AI market. I think the market continues to need more compute. And we also feel very good that our hardware and software solutions are getting good traction, and we're continuing to expand that pipeline.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

I guess sticking on the data center side, as we look forward and you think about the full year, I'm curious of how you're currently thinking about the EPYC server CPU growth expectations as we go forward.

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Aaron. Thanks for the question. So, you know, we're very pleased with the progress that we've made with EPYC. I think a couple of things. First of all, in terms of competitive positioning and just the traction in the market, our fourth-gen EPYC between Gen 1 Bergamo is really doing very well. We've seen broad adoption across cloud. And then we've been very focused on enterprise as well as third-party cloud instances. And as I said in the prepared remarks, we're starting to see very nice traction in enterprise with both new customers as well as existing customers, and then for third-party cloud adoption, also a good pickup there as well. So, I think overall, I think our EPYC portfolio has done well. Going into the second half of the year, I think we also feel good about it. There are a couple of positives there. We see -- first of all, the market looks like it's improving, so we have seen some return to spending in both enterprise and cloud. And so, I think those are positive market trends. And then in addition to that, we are in the process of launching Turin. So, we started production here in the second quarter and we're on track to launch broadly in the second half of the year. We'll see some revenue of Turin in the second half of the year contributing as well. So, overall, I think the server market and our ability to continue to grow share in the server market is one of the things that we see in the second half of the year.

Does the greater than $4.5 billion, does that include any revenue from 325? And can you talk a little bit more about 350? Obviously, we're seeing a big rack scale or shift toward rack-scale systems for the competition's product. And I'm wondering if that's what 350 is going to look like. Is it going to have liquid cooling and is it going to have a rack scale aspect to it? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,7,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely. So, you know, let me start with your original question. I mean, I think looking at 325X, we are on track to launch later this year. From a revenue standpoint, there will be a small contribution in the fourth quarter, but it really is still mostly the MI300 capabilities. And 325 will start in the fourth quarter and then ramp more in the first half of next year. And then as we look at the 350 Series, what we're seeing and the reason we call it a series is because there will be multiple SKUs in that series that we'll go through the range of, let's call it, air-cooled to liquid-cooled. In spending time with our customers. I think there are people who certainly want more rack-level solutions, and we're certainly doing much more in terms of system-level integration for our products. You'll see us invest more in system-level integration. But we also have many customers who want to use their current infrastructure. I think the beauty of the MI350 series is it actually fits into the same infrastructure as the MI300 series. And so, it would lend itself to, let's call it, a pretty fast ramp if you've already invested in 300 or 325. So, we see the range of options, and that's part of the expansion of the road map that we're planning. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Ross Seymore with Deutsche Bank.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,9,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Ross. So, first, you know, we're very pleased with our client business results. I think we have a very strong road map, so I'm very pleased with the road map. The Zen 5-based products, we're launching both notebook and desktop in this -- in the middle of this year. What we've seen is actually very positive feedback on the product. So, we just actually launched the first Strix-based notebooks over the weekend. They went on sale. You may have seen some of the reviews. The reviews are very positive. Our view of this is the AI PC is an important add to the overall PC category. As we go into the second half of the year, I think we have better seasonality in general, and we think we can do, let's call it, above-typical seasonality, given the strength of our product launches and when we're launching. And then into 2025, you're going to see AI PCs across sort of a larger set of price points, which will also open up more opportunities. So, overall, I would say the PC market is a good revenue growth opportunity for us. The business is performing well. The products are strong. And we're working very closely with both the ecosystem partners as well as our OEM partners to have strong launches here into the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to maybe draw a parallel between the Instinct portfolio that your company is rolling out now and what you guys did five or six years ago with EPYC. And I remember when the Naples product launched, there was a lot of, I would say, reaction positively and negatively and sort of sentiment around where your road map might go to relatively small perturbations in what the volumes were. Super early, but if I remember back to that, what was the most important was that was the toehold into the market for long-term engagement, both on the software side and the hardware side with your customers two, three, four generations forward. So, is that an accurate parallel to where you guys are with MI300? And maybe you could talk about the level of engagement, the intensity of engagement, the breadth of it across the customer base with 350 and 400. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Matt. So, look, as I said earlier, we're very pleased with the progress that we're making on the Instinct road map. This is absolutely a long-term play so absolutely, you're correct. It has a lot of parallels to the EPYC journey, where you really have to -- you gain more opportunities, broader workloads, larger deployments as you go from generation to generation. So, we are playing the long game here. Our conversations with our customers, so I would start with first, in the near term, we had some very key milestones that we wanted to pass this year. And as I said, they related to getting hardware in volume in multiple hyperscalers as well as large Tier 2 customers. We've done that. We've now seen our software in a lot of different environments, and it's matured substantially. ROCm is in very, from a standpoint of features, functions, out-of-box performance, getting to performance with customers, we've gained a lot of confidence and learned a lot in that whole process. The networking aspects of building out the rack scale and the system-level items are areas that we're continuing to invest in. And then the point of having long-term conversations across multiple generations is also really important. So, I think all of those things have progressed well. We view this as very good progress for MI300, but we have a lot more to do. And I think the various road maps will help us open up those opportunities over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, there seems to be this ongoing industry debate about AI monetization and whether your customers are getting the right ROI on their capex. And today, they have these three options, right? They can buy GPUs from your largest competitor with all the software bells and whistles and incumbency, or they can do custom chips, or they can buy from AMD. So, how do you think this plays out next year? Do you think your customers, given all this concern around monetization, does it make them consolidate their capex around just the other two suppliers? How is your visibility going into next year, given this industry debate? And how will AMD continue to kind of carve a position between these two other competitive choices that are out there? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think the overall view on AI investment is we have to invest. I mean, the industry has to invest. The potential of AI is so large to impact the way enterprises operate and all that stuff. So, I think the investment cycle will continue to be strong. And then relative to the various choices for the size of the market, I firmly believe that there will be multiple solutions, whether you're talking about GPUs or you're talking about custom chips or ASICs, there will be multiple solutions. In our case, I think we've demonstrated a really strong road map and the ability to partner well with our customers. And from the standpoint of that deep engagement, hardware, software co-optimization is so important in that. And for large language models, GPUs are still the architecture of choice. So, I think the opportunity is very large. And I think our piece of that is really strong technology with strong partnerships with the key AI market makers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question, Joe. So, as we said on MI300, there are lots of great characteristics about it. One of it -- one of them is our memory bandwidth and memory capacity is leading the industry. From that standpoint, the early deployments have largely been inference in most cases, and we've seen fantastic performance from an inference standpoint. We also have customers that are doing training. We've also seen that from a training standpoint, we've optimized quite a bit our ROCm software stack to make it easier for people to train on AMD. And I do expect that we'll continue to ramp training over time. As we go forward, I think you'll see -- the belief is that inference will be larger than training from a market standpoint. But from an AMD standpoint, I would expect both inference and training to be growth opportunities for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Curious if you could provide an update there. And then my Part B to my question is on profitability for MI300. I think in the past, you've talked about the business being accretive and improving further over time as you sort of work through the kinks, if you will.

Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, on the supply side, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe I'll let Jean comment on sort of the trajectory for the business. So, on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So, under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so, we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities, and really that's accelerating our customer adoption overall, and we'll see how things play out as we go into the second half of this year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So, we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average. From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our data center platform, especially both the server and the data center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge.

I wanted to dig into the Q3 guidance a little bit if I could. So, with gaming down double digits, it probably means you've got close to $1 billion of growth revenue across data center, client, and embedded. I was wondering if you could give us some color on how that $1 billion-ish splits out across those three businesses.

So, Harsh, overall, maybe if I take a step back and just talk about how the systems are evolving, there's no question that the systems are getting more complex, especially as you go into large training clusters, and our customers need help to put those together. And that includes the sort of Infinity Fabric-type solutions that are the basis for the UALink things as well as just general rack-level system integration. I think what you should expect, Harsh is, first of all, we're very pleased with all of the partners that have come together for UALink. We think that's an important capability. But we have all of the pieces of this already within sort of the AMD umbrella with our Infinity Fabric, with the work with our networking capability through the acquisition of Pensando.

Thanks for taking my question. I just want to ask another question on MI300. Just curious if you can kind of characterize the makeup of the customers in the first half. I know you had, end of last year, a government customer. Is there still a government contingency? And kind of the second part of it is really you've invested in all these software assets. Kind of curious the challenge of ramping the next wave of customers. I know there's been a lot of talk on some hardware challenges, memory issues, and such, but then you're investing in software. I'm sure that's a big challenge, too. Just kind of curious what the biggest hurdle is for you to kind of get that next wave of customers ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,36,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, Blayne, a lot of pieces to that question so let me try to address them. First, on your question about, I think you're basically asking about the supercomputing piece. That was mainly Q4 and a bit in Q1. So, if you think about our Q2 revenue, think about it as almost all AI. So, it's MI300X, it's for large AI, hyperscalers as well as OEM customers going to enterprise and Tier 2 data centers. So, that's the makeup of the customer set. And then in terms of the various pieces of what we're doing, I think first on your question about memory, I think there's a lot of noise in the system. I wouldn't really pay attention to all that noise in the system. I mean, this has been an incredible ramp. And I'm actually really proud of what the team has done in terms of just definitely fastest product ramp that we've ever done to $1 billion here in the -- over $1 billion in the second quarter and then ramping each quarter in Q3 and Q4. In terms of memory, we have multiple suppliers that we've qualified on HBM3. And it's a tricky -- memory is a tricky business, but I think we've done it very well and that's there. And then we're also qualifying HBM3E for future products with multiple memory suppliers as well. So, to your overarching question of what are the things that we're doing, the exciting part of this is that the ROCm capability has really gotten substantially better because so many customers have been using it. And with that, what we look at is out-of-box performance, how long does it take a customer to get up and running on MI300? And we've seen, depending on the software that companies are using, particularly if you're based on some of the higher-level frameworks like PyTorch, etc., we can be out-of-the-box running very well in a very short amount of time, like, let's call it, very small number of weeks. And that's great because that's expanding the overall portfolio. We are going to continue to invest in software, and that was one of the reasons that we did the Silo AI acquisition. It's a great acquisition for us. 300 scientists and engineers. These are engineers that have experience with AMD hardware and are very, very good at helping customers get up and running on AMD hardware. And that's -- so we view this as the opportunity to expand the customer base with talent like Silo AI, like Nod.ai which brought a lot of compiler talent. And then we continue to hire quite a bit organically. So, I think Jean said earlier that we see leverage in the model, but we're going to continue to invest because this opportunity is huge, and we have all of the pieces. This is just about building out scale.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question. I'll give you a breather from the MI300 for a second, but just to focus on client in the second half. No problem. Focused on client in the second half, you kind of said above seasonal for September, December. You're obviously launching a new notebook, desktop product, but you're also talking about AI PC. Could you just break down where you're seeing those above-seasonal trends? Is it the ASP uplift you're getting from the new products? Is it a unit assumption that's coming with AI PC? Just any kind of breakdown between those two and why you're seeing it a little bit better. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,40,Lisa T. Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Tom. So, I think you actually said it well. We are launching Zen 5 desktops and notebooks with volume ramping in the third quarter. And that's the primary reason that we see above seasonal. The AI PC element is certainly one element of that, but there is just the overall refresh. Usually, desktop launches going into a third quarter are good for us, and we feel that the products are very well-positioned. So, those are the primary reasons. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Chris Danely with Citi.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,41,Christopher Danely,Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, gang, thanks for sneaking me in. Just a question on gross margin. So, if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,42,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yeah, Chris, thanks for the question. I think, first, we have made a lot of progress, as you mentioned, this year to expand our gross margin from 2023 at a 50 percentage point to -- you know, we actually guided 53.5% for Q3. The primary driver is really the faster data center business growth. If you look at the data center business as a percentage of revenue from 37% in Q4 last year to now close to 50%. That faster expansion really helped us with the gross margin. When you look at the second half, we'll continue to see data center to be the major driver of our top-line revenue growth, will help with the margin expansion. But there are some other puts and takes. I think Lisa mentioned the PC business actually is going to do better in second half, especially typically, seasonally, it tends to be more consumer-focused. So, that really is a little bit different dynamics there. Secondly, I would say embedded business, we are going to see embedded business to be up sequentially each quarter. But the recovery, as we mentioned earlier, is more gradual. So, when you look at the balance of the picture, that's why we see the gross margin -- the pace of the gross margin changed a little bit, but we do see continued gross margin expansion. As far as MI300, we are quite confident over the long term, it will be accretive to our corporate average. We feel pretty good about the overall data center business to continue to be absolutely the driver of gross margin expansion.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,1,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, my first question is on the MI300. You're taking up the full-year outlook from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. I'm curious, what's driving that incremental $500 million in revenue? Is it new customers? Is it additional bookings from existing customers? Is it more cloud? Is it more enterprise? If you can sort of provide color there that would be helpful. And then on the supply side, there's been headlines or chatter that CoWos under HBM could be a pretty severe constraining factor for you guys. If you can speak to how you're handling the supply side of the equation, that would be helpful, too. And then I have a quick follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Great. Thank you, Toshiya for the question. Look, the MI300 ramp is going really well. If we look at just what's happened over the last 90 days, we've been working very closely with our customers to qualify MI300 in their production data centers, both from a hardware standpoint, software standpoint. So far, things are going quite well, and what we see now is just greater visibility to both current customers as well as new customers committing to MI300. So that gives us the confidence to go from $3.5 billion to $4 billion. And I view this as you know very much -- as a very dynamic market, and there are lots of customers. We said on the -- in the prepared remarks that we have over 100 customers that were engaged with in both development as well as deployment. So overall the ramp is going really well. As it relates to the supply chain, actually I would say I'm very pleased with how supply has ramped. It is absolutely the fastest product ramp that we have done. It's a very complex product. Chiplets, CoWos, 3D integration, HBM. And so far it's gone extremely well. We've gotten great support from our partners. And I would say even in the quarter that we just finished, we actually did a little bit better than expected when we first started the quarter. I think Q2 will be another significant ramp, and we're going to ramp supply every quarter this year. So I think the supply chain is going well. We are tight on supply. So there's no question in the near term that if we had more supply we have demand uh for that product. And we're going to continue to work on those elements as we go through the year. But I think both on the demand side and the supply side, I'm very pleased with how the ramp is going.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, I was hoping you could speak to your data center GPU roadmap beyond the MI300. The other concern that we hear is your nearest competitor has been pretty transparent with their roadmap, and that extends into '25 and oftentimes '26. So maybe this isn't the right venue for you to give too much. But beyond the MI300, how should we think about your roadmap and your ability to compete in data center? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So look, Toshiya, when we start with the roadmap, I mean we always think about it as a multi-year, multi-generational roadmap. So we have the follow-ons to MI300 as well as the next next generations well in development. I think what is true is we're getting much closer to our top AI customers. They're actually giving us significant feedback on the roadmap and what we need to meet their needs. Our chiplet architecture is actually very flexible, and so that allows us to actually make changes to the roadmap as necessary. So we're very confident in our ability to continue to be very competitive. Frankly, I think we're going to get more competitive. Right now, I think MI300X is in a sweet spot for inference, very, very strong inference performance. I see as we bring in additional products later this year into 2025, that will continue to be a strong spot for us, and then we're also enhancing our training performance and our software roadmap to go along with it. So more details to come in the coming months. But we have a strong roadmap that goes through the next couple of years, and it is informed by just a lot of learning in working with our top customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,7,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, Thanks for having me ask a question. The non AI side of the data center business, it sounds like the enterprise side has some good traction even though the sequential drop happened seasonally, Lisa. But I was just wondering, what's implied in your second-quarter guidance for the data center CPU side of things? And generally speaking, how are you seeing that whole kind of GPU versus CPU crowding out dynamic playing out for the rest of 2024?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. Ross, thanks for the question. I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed. I think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter actually some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of Genoa is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise. In the second quarter, we expect overall data center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business, but we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year. That will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And I guess as my follow-up, just switching over to the client side, I noted you guided it up sequentially. Any sort of magnitudes around that for the second quarter? And perhaps more importantly, when you talk about the whole AI PC side of things, do you believe that's more of a unit driver for you, an ASP driver? Or will it be both?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,10,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, so I think, again I think we're pretty excited about the AI PC, both opportunity in, let's call it, the near term and even more so in the medium term. I think the client business is performing well, both on the channel and on the M&C side. We expect client to be up sequentially in the second quarter. And as we go into the second half of the year, to your question about units versus ASPs, I think we expect some increase in units as well as ASPs. The AI PC products, when we look at the Strix products, it's -- they're really well suited for the premium segments of the market. And I think that's where you're going to see some of the AI PC content strongest in the beginning. And then as we go into 2025, you would see it more across the rest of the portfolio.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,13,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Yes. Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Lisa, I have sort of a longer-term question and then a shorter-term follow-up. One, I guess is the -- one of the questions that I've been getting from folks a lot is, obviously your primary competitor has announced, I guess, a multiyear roadmap. And we continue to hear more and more from other folks about internal ASIC programs at some of your primary customers, whether they be for inference, or training, or both. I guess it would be really helpful if you could to talk to us about how your conversations go with those customers, how committed they are to your long-term roadmap, multi-generation, as you described it, how they juxtapose doing investments of their internal silicon versus using a merchant supplier like yourselves and maybe what advantages the experience across a large footprint of customers can give your company that those guys doing internal ASICs might not get. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So look, I think one of the things that we see and we've said is that the TAM for AI compute is growing extremely quickly, and we see that continuing to be the case in all conversations. We had highlighted a TAM of, let's call it, $400 billion in 2027. I think some people thought that was aggressive at the time. But the overall AI compute needs, as we talk to customers, is very, very strong. And you've seen that in some of the announcements, even recently with some of the largest cloud guys. From my view, there are several aspects of it. First of all, we have great relationships with all of sort of the top AI companies. And the idea there is we want to innovate together. When you look at these large language models and everything that you need for training and inferencing there, although there will be many solutions, I don't think there's just one solution that will fit all. The GPU is still the preferred architecture, especially as the algorithms and the models are continuing to evolve over time, and that favors our architecture and also our ability to really optimize CPU with GPU. So from my standpoint, I think we're very happy with the partnerships that we have. I think this is a huge opportunity for all of us to really innovate together, and we see that there's a very strong commitment to working together over multiple years going forward. And that's, I think, a testament to some of the work that we've done in the past, and that very much is what happened with the epic roadmap as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,15,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Appreciate that, Lisa. As my follow-up, a little bit shorter term. And I guess having followed the company super closely for a long time, I think there's been -- there's always been noise in the system from whether the stock price is $2 a share or $200. There's been kind of always consistent noise one way or the other. But the last 1.5 months has been extreme in that sense. And so I wanted to just -- I've got random reports in my inbox about changes in demand from some of your MI300 customers or planned demand for consuming your product. I think you answered earlier about the supply situation and how you're working with your partners there. But has there been any change from the customers that you're in ramp with now or that you soon will be of what their intention is for demand? Or in fact has that maybe strengthened rather than gone down in recent periods? Because I keep getting questions about it. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,16,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Matt. Look, I think I might have said it earlier, but maybe I'll repeat it again. I think the demand side is actually really strong. And what we see with our customers and what we are tracking very closely is customers moving from, let's call, it initial POCs to pilots, to full scale production, to deployment across multiple workloads. And we're moving through that sequence very well. I feel very good about the deployments and ramps that we have ongoing right now, and I also feel very good about new customers who are sort of earlier on in that process. So from a demand standpoint, we continue to build backlog as well as build engagements going forward. And similarly on the supply standpoint, we're continuing to build supply momentum. But from a speed-of-ramp standpoint, I'm actually really pleased with the progress.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

We also see AI head nodes, as another place where we see growth in, let's call it, the more traditional market. Our sweet spot is really in the highest performance, sort of high core count, energy efficiency space, and that is playing out well. And we're also -- we've traditionally been very strong in, let's call it, cloud first-party workloads. And that is now extending to cloud third-party workloads where we see enterprises who are, let's call it, in more of a hybrid environment adopting AMD both in the cloud and on-prem.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,24,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I just wanted to go back to the supply question and the $4 billion outlook for this year. I think at some point, there was a suggestion that the $4 billion number, right, that there are still supply constraints. But I think at a different point, you said that you have supply visibility significantly beyond that. Given that we are almost at the middle of the year, I would have thought that you would have much better visibility about the back half. So is the $4 billion number a supply constraint number? Or is it a demand constraint number? Or alternatively, if you could give us some sense of what the exit rate of your GPU sales could be. I think on the last call, $1.5 billion was suggested. Could it be a lot more than that in terms of your exit rate of MI for this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 30, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,25,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Vivek. Let me try to make sure that we answer this question clearly. From a full-year standpoint, our $4 billion number is not supply capped. I'm sorry, yes, it's not supply capped. It is -- we do have supply capability above that. It is more back half-weighted. So if you're looking at sort of the near term, the near term, I would say for example in the second quarter, we do have more demand than we have supply right now, and we're continuing to work on pulling in some of that supply. By the way, I think this is an overall industry issue. This is not at all related to AMD. I think overall, AI demand has exceeded anyone's expectations in 2024. So you've heard it from the memory guys. You've heard it from the foundry guys. We're all ramping capacity as we go through the year. And as it relates to visibility, we do have good visibility into what's happening. As I said, we have great customer engagements that are going forward. My goal is to make sure that we pass all of the milestones as we're ramping products. And as we pass those milestones, we put that into the um, the overall full-year guidance for AI. But in terms of how customer progression things are going, they're actually going quite well. And we continue to bring new customers on, and we continue to expand workloads with our current customers. And so hopefully, that clarifies the question, Vivek.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thank you, Lisa. Maybe one nod on MI, but maybe on the embedded business. I think you sound a bit more measured about Q2 and the second half rebound, which is similar to what we have heard from a lot of the auto industrial peers. But where are you in the inventory clearing cycle? And if embedded has a somewhat more measured rebound in the back half, what implication does that have on gross margin expansion? Can we continue to expect, I don't know, 100 basis points a quarter in terms of gross margin expansion because of the data center mix? Or just any puts and takes of embedded, and then what it means for gross margins in the back half. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Thank you for the question. I think the embedded business declined a little bit more than expected really due to the weaker demand in some of the markets. Very specifically, communication has been weak. And some pockets of industrial and automotive, as you mentioned, it's actually quite consistent with the peers. Second half, we do think the first half is the bottom of embedded business, and we'll start to see gradual recovery in the second half. And going back to your gross margin question is when you look at our gross margin expansion in both Q1 and guided Q2, the primary driver is the strong performance on the data center side. The data center will continue to ramp in second half. I think that will continue to be the major driver of gross margin expansion in second half. Of course, if embedded is doing better, we'll have a more tailwind in second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

I also wanted to ask about your data center GPU roadmap. The customers that we talk to say that they're engaged, not just because of MI300 but really because of what's coming, and it seems like there's a big demand shift to rack scale systems that try to optimize performance per square foot given some of the data center and power constraints. So can you just talk about how important systems are going to be in your roadmap And do you have all the pieces you need as the market shifts to rack scale systems?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

Timothy, thanks for the question. For sure, look, our customers are engaged in the multi-generational conversations. So we've -- definitely going out over the next couple of years. And as it relates to the overall system integration, it is quite important. It is something that we're working very closely with our customers and partners on. That's a significant investment in networking, working with a number of networking partners as well to make sure that the scale-out capability is there. And to your question of do we have the pieces, we do absolutely have the pieces. I think the work that we've always done with our Infinity Fabric as well as with our Pensando acquisition, that's brought in a lot of networking expertise. And then we're working across the networking ecosystem with key partners like Broadcom, and Cisco, and Arista who are with us at our AI data center event in December. So our work right now in future generations is not just specifying a GPU. It is specifying, let's call it, full system reference designs, and that's something that will be quite important going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

And then just as a quick follow up, I know you know this year looks like it's going to be pretty back half loaded in your server CPU business just like it was last year. And I know you kind of held our hands at about this time last year, sort of on what the full year could look like and how back end loaded it could be. So I kind of wonder could you give us some milestones in terms of how much server CPU could grow this year, how back end loaded. It could be is it is like up 30% this year for your server CPU business year over year. Is that a reasonable bogey?

Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I wanted to address the MI300 ramp into Q2. So you said you've done $1 billion give or take in cumulative sales, which puts it at maybe, I don't know, maybe $600 million in Q1. You're guiding total revenues up about $225 million into Q2. But you've got client up. You've got traditional data center up. You've got embedded flat. Gaming is going to be down, but I'd hazard a guess that the client and traditional data center like offset it, if not more.

It's -- if you look at the gaming, the demand has been quite weak. That's quite very well known, and also their inventory level. So based on the visibility we have, the first half, both Q1 and Q2, we guided down sequentially more than 30%. We actually think the second half will be lower than first half. That's basically how we're looking at this year for the gaming business. And at the same time, gaming's gross margin is lower than our company average.

I think you're right, is the GPU gross margin right now is below the data center gross margin level. I think there are two reasons. Actually, the major reason is that we actually increase the investment quite significantly to -- as Lisa mentioned, to expand and accelerating our roadmap in the AI side. That's one of the major drivers of the operating income coming down slightly.

Thanks for taking my question. On your data center GPU segment and the faster time to production shipments, given you just upped your full-year GPU outlook, how much of it is faster bring up of your customers frameworks driven by your latest ROCm software platform and maybe stronger collaboration with your customers engineers just to get them to call faster?

What it really is is both us and our customers feeling confident in broadening the ramp. Because if you think about it, first of all, the ROCm stack has done really well. And the work that we're doing is hand in hand with our customers to optimize their key models. And it was important to get sort of verification and validation that everything would run well, and we've now passed some important milestones in that area. And then I think the other thing is, as you said, there's a huge demand for more AI compute and so our ability to participate in that, and help customers get that up and running is great. So I think overall as we look at it, this ramp has been very, very aggressive if you think about where we were just a quarter ago. Each of these are pretty complex bring-ups, and I'm very happy with how they've gone.

Just going back, just kind of rewinding back to the March quarter. So similar to the PC client business, right, which declined at the low end of the seasonal range, if I make certain assumptions around your data center GPU business, I expect that out of data center, it looks like your server CPU business was also down at the lower end of the seasonal range. By my math, it was down like 5%, 6% sequentially. Is that right? And that's less than half the decline of your competitor. And if so, like what drove the less than seasonal declines?

Lisa, I had two. One is for you and one perhaps for Jean. So we recently hosted a very large custom GPU company for a call, and they talked about kind of mega data centers coming up in the near to mid-term, talking about nodes potentially in the 100,000-plus range and maybe up to a million. So as we look out at these kinds of data centers, from an architectural standpoint, is that a situation where winner takes all where if somebody gets in, they kind of get all the sockets? Or will they be lines where your chip perhaps or your board can be placed right next to somebody else's board maybe on a separate line? Just help us understand how something like that would play out if there's a chance for more than one competitor to play in such a large data center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/04/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2024-earnings-call-t/

I think as we look at sort of how AI shapes up over the next few years, there are customers who would be looking at very large training environments. And perhaps, that's what you're talking about. I think our view of that is number one, we view that as a very attractive area for AMD. It's an area where, we believe we have the technology to be very competitive there. And I think the desire would be to have optionality in terms of how you build those out. So obviously a lot has to happen between here and there.

Thanks for taking the question. Just kind of framing the outlook and the guidance for this calendar first quarter. I guess the first question is, can you help us on a relative basis the $400 million of Data Center GPU revenue that you expected in Q4. What did that ultimately kind of fell off to be? And then, on the guidance into 1Q, can you help us appreciate what seasonal is defined as, as we think about the server business into the 1Q guide?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Aaron. Let me start and then see if Jean has something to add. So, relative to the Data Center GPU business, we were very pleased with performance that we saw in the fourth quarter. It was always going to be a very sort of back-end quarter weighted as we were ramping the product and we saw MI300A, our HPC product actually ramped very well. And then, we saw MI300X. The AI product actually exceed our expectations based on strong customer demand, the way the qualifications went and then the ramp -- manufacturing ramp. So, we were over $400 million for that business in the fourth quarter. And then, going into the first quarter, as we look at the business, server seasonality, call it, something around, let's call it, high-single-digit, low-double-digit. There are also some other pieces of the Data Center business. I think, the key piece of it is we had originally expected the ramp to be a little bit more shallow of our MI300X and what we're seeing now is the supply chain is operating really well, and the customer demand is strong. And so, we will see MI300X increase as we go into the first quarter, and things are going relatively well so.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, Client is very similar to server, typically Q1 is high-single-digit to low-double-digit. That's consistent with past. On the Embedded side, it's very consistent with what we said in the past and the consistent with what you see in the industry's Embedded business is going through a bottoming process, and we think Q1, it will have a low-double-digit sequential decline. That's Embedded. On the Gaming side, Lisa mentioned during his -- her prepared remarks is we have the latest stage of product cycle in the year five of gaming console. But at the same time, we also have inventory at the customers. So, the combination of those impact, we expect the Q1 Gaming sequential declines probably more than 30%, so hopefully that help you a little bit.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Very helpful, Jean. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious. The traditional server demand that you see, I know when we looked at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year over year. Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it, non-AI general-purpose server market as we move through '24?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,5,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Aaron. So look, I think, I agree with your characterization of the 2023 demand, although we did see some strong progress in the second half of the year, especially as customers in Cloud and Enterprise adopted our Genoa and our Zen 4 family. So going into 2024, I would say the traditional server market is probably still mixed, especially into the first half of the year. There's still some cloud optimization going on, as well as sort of enterprise being a little bit cautious. That being the case though, we also see opportunities for us to continue to grow share in the traditional server business. I think our portfolio is extremely strong. The adoption of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as our new Siena product lines are getting a lot of traction. And then, we also see Turin, our Zen 5 product coming in the second half of the year. So, even in a mixed demand environment, I think we're bullish on what traditional server CPUs can do in 2024. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Lisa, I'm wondering if you can give us a little bit of sense in terms of the milepost that you're kind of marching toward on this $400 billion TAM that you have for 2027. For example, do you think you can gain share at a rate that's kind of similar to the rate that you gained share for server CPU or I guess maybe asked a different way, is it reasonable to kind of look at your consumer GPU share of 20 plus percent, is that a reasonable bogey, or do you have aspirations higher than that, perhaps?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks, Tim, for the question. I would say a couple of things. First of all, we're really pleased with the progress that we've made in our Data Center GPU business. I think the ramp that we've seen, the customer traction that we've seen even in the last few months, I think has been great. And that gives us a lot of confidence in the ramp of this business. I think the beauty of the AI market here is, it's growing so quickly that I think we have both the market dynamic, as well as our ability to gain share in that framework. The point I will make is our customer engagements right now are all quite strategic, dozens of customers with multi-generational conversations. So, as excited as we are about the ramp of MI300 and, frankly, there's a lot to do in 2024. We are also very excited about the opportunities to extend that into the next couple of years out into that '25, '26, '27 timeframe. So, I think, we see a lot of growth. I think it's a little early to make market share projections, but I would say it's a significant growth driver given the market demand, as well as our own product capabilities.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Jean, I guess as a follow-up. I know that you don't want to guide the full year. But I'm wondering if I can pin you down just to touch on maybe a milepost that you're kind of marching to for 2024 growth is up 20% for the whole company. Is that a reasonable target? And then, I guess within Data Center, if you just add the incremental Data Center GPU revenue and you assume that the server business grows a little bit, it seems like that should maybe double year over year, but I'm kind of wondering if you can give us any ranges on those numbers?

Thank you for the question. Yeah, we're not guiding a year. It's very early of the year, literally, January. I think the way to think about it is, Lisa mentioned during her prepared remarks we feel pretty good about both our Data Center and the Client business to grow in 2024. Of course, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center between both the server side gaining more share, and Data Center GPU side with the significant ramp up of our MI300. I think that's how we think about it. We do have a headwind from Gaming segment. We do think year over year, we'll see very significant double-digit decline on the Gaming segment. And at the same time Embedded is going through the bottoming process. We do think the second-half we will see the recovery. So those are the puts and takes. I can talk about it.

Good afternoon. Lisa. I wanted to ask, I mean, there's been so much focus and scrutiny as there should be on the really exciting progression with MI300 and I mean, we've progressed over the last six months from I think some doubts in the investment community on to software and your ability to ramp the product and now you've proven that you're ramping it what, I think you said dozens of customers right across different end-markets. So, it's what I'm interested in hearing a little bit more about and you guys have been open about what some of the forward programs in your traditional server business look like from a roadmap perspective. I'd be interested to hear how you're thinking about the roadmap in your MI accelerator family. Is it going to -- they're going to continue to be parts that are CPU and GPU together? Or is that a primarily a GPU only roadmap? What kind of cadence are you thinking about? I'd just be, any kind of color you can give us on some of the forward roadmap trajectory for that program would be really helpful. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. So, I appreciate the comments. I think the traction that we're getting with the MI300 family is really strong. I think what's benefited us here is our use of chiplet technologies, which has given us the ability to have sort of both the APU version, as well as the GPU version and we continue to use that to differentiate ourselves and that's how we get our memory bandwidth and memory capacity advantages. As we go forward, you can imagine, like we did in the EPYC timeframe, we planned multiple generations in sequence. That's the way we're planning the roadmap. One of the things I will note about the AI accelerator market is the demand for compute is so high that we are seeing sort of an acceleration of the roadmap generations here and we are similarly planning acceleration of our roadmap. I would say that we'll talk more about the overall roadmap beyond MI300 as we get into later this year. But you can be assured that we're working very closely with our customers to have a very competitive roadmap for both training and inference that will come out over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Just as a follow-up, I guess one of the questions that I've been getting a lot in different forms is, with respect to the $400 billion TAM that you guys have laid out for 2027. Maybe you could give us a little look under the hood as the, I guess, the -- I've got 100 versions of the same question which is, how the heck did you come up with that number. So, if you could give us a little bit more in terms of are we talking about systems and accelerator cards? Are we talking about just the silicon? Are we talking about full servers? And what kind of sort of unit assumptions? Any kind of thing that you can give us on-market sizing or what gives you the visibility so early into this generative AI trend to give a precise number of three years out? That would be really, really helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,13,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Well, Matt, I don't know-how precise it is, but I think we said approximately $400 billion. But I think what we need to look at is growth rate and how do we get to those growth rates. I think we expect units to grow sort of substantial double-digit percentage. But you should also expect that content is going to grow. So, if you think about how important memory and memory capacity is as we go forward, you can imagine that we'll see acceleration there and just the overall content as we go to more advanced technology nodes. So, there's some ASP uplift in there. And then, what we also do is, we are planning longer-term roadmaps with our customers in terms of how they're thinking about sort of the size of training clusters, the number of training clusters. And then, the fact that we believe inference is actually going to exceed training as we go into the next couple of years just given as more enterprises adopt. So, I think as we look at all those pieces, I think we feel good that the growth rate is going to be significant and sustained over the next few years. In terms of what's in that TAM, it really is accelerator TAM. So, within accelerators, there are certainly GPUs and there will also be some ASICs that are other accelerators that are in that TAM. As we think about sort of the different types of models from smaller models to fine-tuning of models, to the largest large language models, I think you're going to need different silicon for those different use cases. But from our standpoint, GPUs are still going to be the sort of the compute element of choice when you're talking about training and inferencing on the largest language models. Operator And the next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

I think you talked about the MI300 cloud workloads being kind of split between the more customer-facing workloads versus internal. Can you talk about how you see the breakdown of that and how is your ecosystem progressing? This is a brand-new chip. It seems impressive they are able to support kind of a broad range of customer-facing workloads and cloud.,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,15,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Joe. So, yes, look, we are really happy with how the MI300 has come up and we've now deployed and working with a number of customers. What we have seen is certainly ROCm 6 has been a very important, as well as the direct optimization with our top cloud customers. We always said that the best way of optimizing the software is working directly on the most important workloads. And we've seen performance come up nicely, which is what we expect frankly with the GPU capabilities that we would have to do some level of optimization, but the optimization has gone well. I think to your broader question. The way I look at this is, there are lots of opportunities for us to work directly with large customers, both on the Cloud side, as well as on the Enterprise side, who have specific training and inferencing workloads. Our job is to make it as easy as possible for them and so our entire tool chain all of our, sort of the overall ROCm suite has really gone through significant progress over the last six to nine months. And then, we're also getting some nice support from the open-source community. So, the work that Hugging Face is doing is tremendous. In terms of just real-time optimization on our hardware, our partnership with OpenAI on Triton and our work across a number of these open source models has helped us actually make very rapid progress.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, I guess a lot of the forecasting of your business that I'm hearing is coming from supply chain and we're sort of hearing AMD is building X in Asia. I guess, how would you ask us to think about that? Are you looking at being kind of sold-out for the year and so the supply chain would be close to revenue? Are you building for the best-case scenario? Just I worry about sometimes expectations when people hear the supply chain numbers. And I'm just curious how you bridge the gap.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, I mean, Joe, I think we updated our revenue expectations this quarter from our original number of $2 billion to $3.5 billion to try to give some bounding on some of the discussion out there. The way to think about the $3.5 billion is these are customers that we're working with, who have given us firm commitments on what they need. As you know, the lead times on these products are quite long. So, it's important to have those forecasts in early and we have a strong order book. So, that gives us good confidence to exceed the $3.5 billion. From a supply chain standpoint, our goal is always to build more supply we -- and so, from that standpoint, we have also worked with our supply chain partners and secured significant capacity. Think about it as first half capacity is tight and more comes on in the second half of the year, but we've certainly made more progress there. So, we do have more supply, and we're going to continue to work with our customers on their deployments and we'll update that number as we go through the year.

Thank you for taking the question. I had one on the MI300 as well, Lisa. I guess, first of all, how should we think about the quarterly trajectory beyond Q1? You talked about Q1 being up sequentially. Is it fair to assume kind of a straight line as we progress through the balance of the year? Or is it more second half skewed? How should we think about that? And I guess more importantly, some of the cloud potential customers that have yet to officially sign-up for or sign-off on the MI300. I guess what's the sticking point? Is it just a function of time and you just need a little bit more time to go back-and-forth and tweak things or is there a software kind of concern? I guess what's holding them back at this point?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Toshiya, thanks for the question. So, first on the MI300 trajectory. I think you would expect that revenue should increase every quarter from now through sort of the end of the year, but it will be a bit more second half weighted and part of that is just customers as they're finishing up their qualifications in their lines, as well as sort of how our supply chain is ramping. So, yes, it should increase each quarter, but be a bit more second half weighted. And then, to your comment about customers, look, we are engaged with all of sort of the large customers. These are all folks that know what's really well, given our deep relationships in EPYC. I think people just have different adoption cycles as they consider what they're trying to do in their roadmap. But I view this as still very, very early innings for us in this space. And I think the question was asked earlier. I think the key is this is not just about MI300 conversation. But it really is about sort of our long-term multi-generational roadmap. And so, that's the context on which we're working with our largest customers, as well as, as you know, there's a lot of demand coming from folks that are more AI centric and not necessarily typical cloud customers, but more enterprise or let's call it AI-specific companies that we're also very well engaged with.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

That's super helpful. And then, as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side. You're guiding Q1 to 52%. I'm curious, again, I'm sure you're not going to give quantitative guidance beyond Q1, but how to think about the trajectory for Q2 and beyond? I'm pretty sure you're working through some kinks as it pertains to the Instinct ramp. Hopefully, that improves over time. So that should be a tailwind. FPGAs perhaps the second half turns for the better. And you've got server CPU volume growth throughout the year. So, it feels like you've got multiple tailwinds as we think about gross margin progression on a sequential basis. But what are the potential headwinds as we move throughout 2024?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,21,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Toshiya, thank you for the question. Yeah, you're absolutely right. We have some puts and takes that impact our gross margin. We guided the Q1, 120 basis points higher than Q4 sequentially, primarily because the higher Data Center contribution actually more than offset the decline of Embedded business in Q1. Going forward, the way to think about it is as you said is the major driver is going to be Data Center business is going to grow much faster than other segment. That mix change will help us to expand the gross margin nicely. I think you also are spot on, the Embedded coming back in second half, which will be a tailwind. With the Data Center GPU, we are at the very early stage of ramp. We are improving testing time yield and continue to expand gross margin and we expect to be accretive to corporate average. So, those are all the tailwinds coming in the second half. I would say the headwinds side continue to be in the first half where we see Embedded business not only Q1 we see sequential decline, Q2 probably are going to be sequentially flattish versus Q1. That is a headwind for us. Because it does have a very nice gross margin. But overall, we feel pretty good about the trajectory of the gross margin improvement, especially second half.

I wanted to get into the competitive environment. First on the Instinct side of things. How that's going? It doesn't seem to be slowing down your ramp whatsoever, but then also on the straight server CPU side of things. Lisa, you said you're gaining share in that area. But as we think about future road maps, pricing incentives, those sorts of things, any meaningful change in the competitive environment that you're seeing throughout 2024?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

So look, I think the environment for us is always competitive. So, I think that has not changed. If I look at the Instinct side, I think we have -- I think we've shown that MI300 and our roadmap are actually very competitive. There are some places where let's call it, it's more even like in the training environment. But as we look at the inferencing environment, we think we have significant advantages. And that's showing through in some of our customer work. So we think for both training and inference, we will continue to be very competitive. And then, as you go into the CPU side again, from our view, with each generation of EPYC, we've continued to gain share. I think, we exited the fourth quarter at record share for AMD. And we're still quite underrepresented in Enterprise. So I think there is an opportunity for us to continue to gain share as we go through 2024.

I guess as my follow up. On the Data Center side, another theme that's been pervasive throughout 2023 at least was the GPU side driving out the CPU side. You mentioned that there is still a little bit of cloud digestion going on within your EPYC business. But where do you see that standing? I know you're going to gain share, etc., but you guys fully benefit from the Instinct side for the Data Center GPU side, but what about on the CPU side of things? Is that headwind now behind us or is it still an issue?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,25,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I think we expect the CPU business from a market standpoint to grow, Ross. As we go into 2024, I think the rate and pace of growth will depend a little bit on the macro and just overall capex trends. But from our standpoint, we are starting to see some of our larger customers plan their refresh cycles. There's a lot of let's call it older equipment that has yet to be refreshed and the value proposition for refresh is so strong because the energy efficiency and sort of the footprint of the newer generations are so much better than sort of the four or five year old infrastructure that we do see that refresh cycle happening as we get into 2024. I think the exact timing, we will have to understand more as it, as the market evolves as we go through the year.

So first one, Lisa, from you gave us the $2 billion plus number for MI before, now you've have raised it to over $3.5 billion. And I'm curious what drove the change, was it incremental demand signals, was it supply? And can you supply more of, let's say, demand is $4 billion or $5 billion or $6 billion, right, what is the limitation? And sort of related to that, on the competition side, your competitor will launch their B100 later in the year, do you think that will change the competitive landscape in anyway?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Vivek. So, I think what we said is as we went from $2 billion to $3.5 billion, it really is mostly customer demand signals. So as orders have come on books and as we've seen programs moved from, let's call it, pilot programs into full manufacturing programs, we have updated the revenue forecast. As I said earlier, from a supply standpoint, we are planning for success. And so, we worked closely with our supply chain partners to ensure that we can ship more than $3.5 billion, substantially more depending on what customer demand is as we go into the second half of the year. And then, in terms of again roadmaps, as I said, we are very focused on a competitive roadmap this -- that sort of what the next generations are beyond MI300. So, I do believe that we have a strong roadmap in-place and continue to work with our customers to sort of adopt our roadmap as quickly as possible.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

And a longer-term question, Lisa. If I look at the success that AMD has enjoyed, its many factors, but a few of them included your early adoption of chiplets and the strong partnerships you have had with TSMC. But now we are seeing your x86 competitor Intel also adopt chiplet or tile technology as they call it. And then, I think recently the manufacturing update they gave, they said, they are two years ahead in terms of incorporating gate all-around and backside our delivery. So, let's assume they are right and they have either caught up to TSMC or maybe they are ahead. What impact does that have on AMD in kind of the medium to longer term?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Vivek. Look, we're always looking at what's next, right? So, on the chiplet technology, I mean, we're sort of on the fourth generation of the chiplet technologies. I think we've learned a lot about how to optimize performance there. We are very aggressive with our adoption of leading-edge technology as it's needed. But I think those are only a few of the pieces. We're also focused on continuing to innovate on architecture and design. So, I think the longer-term question that you ask is I think we're expecting that the competition is going to be on a similar process technology and even in that case, I think we feel like we have a very strong roadmap going forward and will continue to drive both the CPU and the GPU roadmap very aggressively.

Thanks for letting me ask the question, guys. I have two questions. Let me start-off with the accelerator side. The question we get a lot from our customers is they want to understand the value proposition of the MI300. So, Lisa, I was hoping you could give us some understanding of price versus power comparison or compute power? And then, today, are you seeing your customers that are buying the MI300 are they primarily buying it for inferencing today or are they using it primarily for tooling? And maybe for Jean. Jean, do you think is it possible for MI300 to finish the year at a run-rate of about $1.5 billion?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 31, 2024","December 31, 2023.",1,31,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- OK, Harsh. So, let me start, to your question about the value proposition for MI300. Again, customers are using it for different reasons, but presume that there is a performance per dollar benefit to using AMD. So that's one piece of it. The other piece of it though is we intrinsically have more bandwidth and memory capacity on MI300X compared to the competition. And what that means is for large language models that are many tens of billions of parameters you make -- you could potentially do the workload in fewer GPUs. So, it's a substantial system savings and allows you to do much more work within the same system. In terms of what customers are using MI300 for today, I would say there are a number of customers using it for large language model inferencing and there are also customers that are using it for training. So I think the whole point is being a strong partner. When you put these AI systems in-place, they are sometimes mixed-use systems. So they would be used for both training and inference.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/01/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2023-earnings-call-t/

Let me answer your question about the MI300. Exiting Q4 2024, is it possible to get to $1.5 billion? It is possible, right, because Lisa mentioned earlier, we'll see sequential increase in each quarter and more back-end loaded in second-half and we do have a supplies more than $3.5 billion. And of course we will continue to make progress with our customers. So the math, yeah, it's possible, but right now we are really looking at focus on the execution of the current $3.5 billion plus.

Thanks for taking my questions. For the first one, you talked about the -- you expected a more shallow ramp of the MI300 and it's clearly doing better than that. So, some of the upside I guess in the near-term is that being pulled forward from the second-half or is this like a step-up or is it more of a step-up in-demand both in the first half and the second-half relative to what you were seeing before?

I don't think it's a pull-forward of demand. I think what it is we wanted to see how long it would take for customers to fully qualify and get their workloads performance. So, yeah, that depends a lot on the actual engineering work that's done and now that we're, let's call it a quarter later, we've seen that it's gone really well.

We'll see what happens over the next few years. But I'd like to kind of reemphasize what I said earlier, even in the case of process parity, we feel very good about our architectural roadmap and all the other things that we add, as we look at our entire portfolio of CPUs, GPUs, DPUs, adaptive SoCs and kind of put them together to solve problems. I think we feel really good about what we can do with our customers. So, we're always going to be paying attention to sort of the process race, but I think we feel very good about sort of our strategy and how do we continue to sort of push the envelope on the computing roadmaps.

Lisa, I had two questions. My first one is on the Data Center GPU business. You talked about '24 revenue potentially exceeding $2 billion. I was hoping you could provide a little bit more color. What percentage of this is AI versus supercomputing or other applications? Within AI, maybe talk about the breadth of your customer lineup. And how should we think about which workloads you're addressing, again, within the context of AI? Is it primarily training or inference or both?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Great. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So, look, we've made significant progress on the overall MI300 program. I think we're very happy with how the technical milestones look. And then also, we've made significant progress from a customer side. Your question as to how the revenue evolves, so the way to think about it is, in the fourth quarter, we said revenue would be approximately $400 million, and that's mostly HPC with some -- the start of our AI ramp. And then as we go into the first quarter, we actually expect revenue to be approximately similar in that $400 million range. And that will be mostly AI so with a very small piece being HPC. And as we go through 2024, we would expect revenue to continue to ramp quarterly, and again, it will be mostly AI. Within the AI space, we've had very good customer engagement across the board from hyperscalers to OEMs, enterprise customers, and some of the new AI start-ups that are out there. From a workload standpoint, we would expect MI300 to be on both training and inference workloads. We're very pleased with the inference performance on MI300, especially for large language model inference, given some of our memory bandwidth and memory capacity. We think that's going to be a significant workload for us. But I think we would see a broad set of workloads as well as broad customer adoption.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, a question on the server CPU side. You talked about Genoa growing really nicely in the quarter. I think you talked about both units and volume being bigger than its predecessor. Is the growth that you're seeing or the growth that you saw in Q3 and the growth that you're guiding to for Q4, is this primarily a function of share growth or are you actually seeing a pickup in the overall market? And I ask the question because, obviously, year to date, there's been a significant shift away from traditional compute to accelerated computing, but are you actually starting to see signs of stabilization or even improvement on the traditional compute side? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, the way I would frame it is we're very pleased with our third-quarter performance as it relates to EPYC overall. I think the fourth-gen EPYC, so that's Genoa Plus Bergamo actually ramped very nicely. We got to a crossover in the third quarter, which is a little bit ahead of what we had previously forecasted. And when I look underneath that, I would say with a strong growth in both cloud – you know, cloud was strong so strong double digits. The adoption is pretty broad across first-party and third-party workloads and new instances. And then on the enterprise side, we've also seen some nice growth across our OEMs. And so, from the standpoint of, is it the market recovery or is it share gain? I think it's some of both. From a market standpoint, I would say it's still mixed. I think enterprise is still a little bit mixed depending on sort of which region from a macroeconomic standpoint. Cloud depends a bit on the customer set. But overall, I think we're pleased with the progress, and the leadership of EPYC has ended up allowing us to grow substantially in the third quarter and then into the fourth quarter.

Just to build off that last question, Jean, I think last quarter, you kind of endorsed the notion that your Data Center business would grow. I think it was in the high single-digit range. I think you started the year thinking like 10. So, I guess the question is, do you still see that kind of growth rate setup? And how has that $400 million evolved underneath that? Has that -- was it $300 million now going to $400 million? Just how has that changed over the course of the last quarter just to level set that Data Center expectation?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, I think for the second half, we said we expect Data Center business to grow approximately 50% versus first half. But right now, based on what we are seeing, we continue to see in that similar range of that 50%. So, we are very happy and pleased about the strong momentum of our Data Center business. On the GPU side, Lisa mentioned about $400 million, around $400 million. As we go through the quarter, we have a strong engagement with the customers.

So, on the gross margin side, we do expect our GPU gross margin to be accretive to corporate average. Of course, right now, we are at a very, very early beginning of the ramp of the product. As you probably know, typically when you ramp new product, it takes some time to improve yield, testing time, manufacturing efficiency.

Lisa, I also wanted to ask about that $2 billion number for Data Center GPU next year. That's still a pretty small portion, obviously, of the total TAM. Where do you think that can go?

I think we all see the growth in generative AI workloads. And the fact is we're just at the very early innings of people truly adopting it for enterprise business productivity applications. So, I think we are big believers in the strength of the market. We previously said we believe that the compound annual growth rate could be 50% over the next three or four years. And so, we think the market is huge and there will be multiple winners in this market. Certainly, from our standpoint, we want to be -- we're playing to win and we think MI300 is a great product, but we also have a strong road map beyond that for the next couple of generations. And we would like to be a significant player in this market. So, we'll see how things play out.

And then Jean, I just wanted to ask on March. I know that there's a lot of moving parts. It sounds like Data Center is up, but PC is going to be down, normal seasonal. And Embedded and Gaming sound down as well. So, can you just help us shape sort of how to think about March? Is it down a smidge? Is it flat? Could it be up a little bit?

But just to help you with some of the color, as Lisa mentioned earlier, we said the Data Center GPU revenue will be flattish sequentially. That's the first thing, right? The mix will shift from El Capitan majority in Q4 to predominantly more for AI in Q1. So, because of the long lead time manufacturing cycle, we feel like it's going to be a similar level of revenue with the Data Center GPU. But in general, if you look at our business, we do have a seasonality. Typically, Q1, the Client business, server business, Gaming business seasonally is down. Of course, right now, we definitely have a little bit more seasonality, given Embedded and the Gaming dynamics we are seeing right now. Server and Client typically were down sequentially, seasonally too. But overall, I think we are really focused on just execution. We probably can provide more color when we get close to Q1 2024, and especially, Lisa, please add if we have any color we can provide on the whole year 2024.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

No, I think that covers it. When we look at the various pluses and minuses, I think we feel very good about the Data Center business. It continues to be a strong growth driver for us as we think about 2024 for both server as well as our MI300 clients as well, we think incrementally improves from a market standpoint as well as we believe we can gain share, given the strength of our product portfolio. And then we have the headwinds of Embedded in the inventory correction that we'll go through in the first half and the console cycle. So, I think those are the puts and takes.

Lisa, on the MI300, many of your hyperscaler customers have internal ASIC solutions ready or in the process of getting them ready. So, if inference is the primary workload for MI300, do you think it is exposed to replacement by internal ASICs over time? Or do you think both MI300 and ASICs can coexist, right, along with the incumbent GPU solution?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I think, Vivek, when we look at the set of AI workloads going forward, we actually think they're pretty diverse. I mean, you have sort of the large language model training and inference then you have what you might do in terms of fine-tuning off of a foundational model and then you have, let's call it, straight inferencing what you might do there. So, I think within that framework, we absolutely believe that MI300 has a strong place in the market, and that's what our customers are telling us and we're working very closely with them. So, yes, I think there will be other solutions, but I think for the -- particularly for the LLMs, I think GPUs are going to be the processing of choice and MI300's very, very capable.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then a question, Lisa, on just this interplay between AI and traditional computing. It seems like especially when it relates to ASPs and units, seems like server CPU makers are kind of holding the line on price per core. But at the same time, the cloud players are extending the depreciation and replacement cycle of traditional server CPUs. So, I'm just curious to get your take. What do you think is the interplay between units and ASP, right? If you were to take a snapshot of what you have seen in '23 and how it kind of informs you as you look at '24, that is it possible that maybe unit growth in server is not that high but you are able to make up for it on the ASP side. So, just give us some color on, one, what is happening to traditional computing deployments? And secondly, is there a difference in kind of the unit and ASP interplay on the server CPU side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think it's a good point, Vivek. So, I mean, if I take a look at 2023, I think it's been a mixed environment, right? There was a good amount of, let's call it, caution in the overall server market. There was a bit of inventory digestion at some of the cloud guys and then some optimization going on with enterprise, again, somewhat mixed. I think as we go forward, we've returned to growth in the server CPU market. Within that realm, because these -- like for example, fourth-gen EPYC, somewhere between 96 and 128 cores. I mean, you just get a lot of compute for that. So, I do think there is the framework -- that unit growth may be more modest, but ASP growth, given the core count and the compute capability will contribute to overall growth. So, from a traditional server CPU standpoint, I think we do see those trends. 2023 was a mixed environment and I think it improves as we go into 2024.

I want to ask on the Embedded side. I think last quarter, you kind of talked about the headwinds being mostly in the communications end market. You're guiding it down in December. I was curious if that weakness is spread. And then your competitor talked about kind of a reset getting back to pre-pandemic levels. Just kind of curious how you framed that reset. You said it'd be weak to the first half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,24,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Blayne. So, I think when we look at end markets, I think communications was weak in sort of last quarter and it certainly continues to be weak. We see 5G sort of capex just down overall. On the other market where we see a little bit of, let's call it, soft end market demand would be industrial and that's a little bit more geographic, so a little bit worse in Europe than in other geographies. The other end markets are actually relatively good. And what we just see is that inventory is high, just given where we were with lead times coming into the sort of through the pandemic and with the high demand that was out there. As the lead times have normalized, people are drawing down their inventories and they have an opportunity to do that, given the normalization. So, from an overall standpoint, we think demand is solid. And what we view is that we have a very strong portfolio in Embedded. We like sort of the combination of the, let's call it, the classic Xilinx portfolio together with the Embedded processing capabilities that we add. Customers have seen sort of that portfolio come together, and we've gotten some nice design win traction as a result of that. So, we have to get through sort of the next couple of quarters of inventory correction, and then we believe we'll return to growth in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then I just wanted to ask on the PC market. I think you and Intel have seen -- you were under-shipping in the first half. Maybe you're kind of over shipping a little bit now, restocking. I'm just kind of curious of your perspective of what that normalized run rate is in terms of the size of the PC market and kind of any perspective if inventory levels are starting to move back up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I would say, again, Blayne, when we looked at sort of the third quarter and sort of the environment that we're in now, I think inventory levels are relatively normalized, and so the selling and consumption are fairly close. We were building up for a holiday season that is a strong season for us overall. When I think about the size of the market, I think from a consumption standpoint this year is probably somewhere like 250 million to 255 million units or so. We expect some growth going into 2024 as we think about sort of the AI PC cycle and some of the Windows refresh cycles that are out there. And I think the PC market returns to, let's call it, a typical seasonality, in which underneath that, we have a strong product portfolio. And we are very much focused on growing in places like high-end gaming, ultrathins, premium consumer as well as commercial. So, those are -- that's how sort of we see the PC market.

Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to maybe ask the AI question a little bit differently, not just focused on your GPU portfolio but more broadly. I think one of the big surprises to a lot of us is how quickly the AI market changed from accelerator cards to selling full servers or full systems for your primary competitor. And they've done a lot of innovation not just on GPU but on CPU on their own custom interconnect, etc. So, what I'd like to hear a little bit of an update on is just how you think about your road map going forward across CPU, GPU, and networking and particularly the networking part as you look to continue to advance your AI portfolio. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,28,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Matt. I think it's an important point. What we're seeing with these AI systems is they are truly complicated when you think about putting all of these components together. We are certainly working very closely with our partners in putting together sort of the full system, CPU, GPUs, as well as the networking capability. Our Pensando acquisition has actually been really helpful in this area. I think we have a world-class team of experts in this area, and we're also partnered with some of the networking ecosystem overall. So, going forward, I don't think we're going to sell full systems, let's call it, AMD-branded systems. We believe that there are others who are more set up for that. But I think from a definition standpoint and when we're doing development, we are certainly doing development with the notion of what that full system will look like. And we'll work very closely with our partners to ensure that that's well defined so that it's easy for customers to adopt our solutions.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

As my second question, Jean, I wanted to dig into gross margin a little bit and just, I guess, compliment you and the team on being able to guide up for the fourth quarter. Sequentially, gross margin if we, I guess, rewound the clock back to the beginning of the year, and the Embedded segment would be down from the peak to where you're guiding the fourth quarter, maybe down by a third. I wouldn't have thought gross margin would have hung in as well and grown sequentially each quarter through the year. Obviously, Client margins got better. But maybe you could walk us through some of the puts and takes on gross margin, and inside of each segment, where you're making progress because I imagine some of that progress is pretty positive underneath.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,30,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Matt, thank you for the question. Yes, there are a few puts and takes, especially in a mixed demand environment. So, let me just comment on Q3 first. We are very pleased with our gross margin expansion sequentially, 140 basis points. As you mentioned, the Embedded segment, revenue actually declined double digits sequentially. There are two primary drivers. The first one is definitely Data Center grew 21% sequentially, which should provide a tailwind to our gross margin. Secondly, as we go through the inventory correction in PC market, we did encounter some headwinds in the Client segment gross margin. And in Q3, we saw very significant improvement with our client segment gross margin. I think going forward, the pace of Client segment improvement will moderate, but it will continue to drive incremental gross margin improvement in Client segment. So, that really is why we are able to drive sequential growth in Q3. And in Q4, I would say the major dynamics is with a very strong double-digit growth in Data Center business, we definitely have the tailwind, which more than offset the Embedded segment decline sequentially double digit again. I think going forward, it's really mix, primarily mix, is driving our gross margin, but we feel pretty good about second half next year when we can expand the Data Center significantly and especially Embedded segment start to recover, we should be able to drive more meaningful gross margin improvement in second half.

Lisa, I had a question on the MI300 side of things. When you go to market, obviously, there's been shortages this year of GPU accelerators, and so a second source is definitely needed. But beyond just providing that second source role, can you just walk us through some of the competitive advantages that the customer lists that you're going to talk about on the sixth is finding to be so attractive relative to your primary competitor?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 31, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think there's a couple of different things, Ross. I mean, if we start with, it's just a very capable product. The way it's designed from a triplet standpoint, we have a very strong compute as well as memory capacity and memory bandwidth. In inference, in particular, that's very helpful. And the way to think about it is on these larger language models, you can't fit the model on one GPU. You actually need multiple GPUs. And if you have more memory, you can actually use fewer GPUs to infer those models, and so it's very beneficial from a total cost of ownership standpoint. From a software standpoint, this has been perhaps the area where we've had to invest more and do more work. Our customers and partners are actually moving toward an area where they're more able to move across different hardware so really optimizing at the higher-level frameworks. And that's reducing the barrier of entry of sort of taking on a new solution. And we're also talking very much about, going forward, what the road map is. It's very similar to our EPYC evolution. When you think about sort of the -- our closest partners in the cloud environment, we work very closely to make each generation better. So, I think MI300 is an excellent product, and we'll keep evolving on that as we go through the next couple of generations.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Our team has done an absolutely great job in reallocating resources within our budget envelope to really invest in the most important areas in AI and the data center. We are actually in the planning process for 2024. I can comment on a very high level, given tremendous opportunities we have in AI and the Data Center, we definitely will increase both R&D investment and go-to-market investment to address those opportunities. I think the way to think about it is our objective is to drive top-line revenue growth much faster than opex growth, so our investment can drive long-term growth. And we also can leverage our operating model really actually expand earnings much faster than revenue. That's really how we think about running the company and driving the operating margin expansion.

Lisa, I had a strategic one for you and then somewhat of a tactical one. On the strategic side, as your key competitor is sort of getting their act together on the manufacturing technology and the nodes, would it not be feasible to think that their manufacturing cost could be significantly better, let's say, than that of yours? And so, if that's the case down the line one year or two years out, I'm curious what kind of value-add offerings would AMD have to provide to a customer to keep the market share that you have in the server space, data center space and then keep that growing as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Harsh, maybe I should just take a step back and just talk about sort of the engagement that we have with our data center customers. When we think about sort of the EPYC portfolio and what we've been able to build over the last few generations and what we have going forward with Zen 5 and beyond, process technology is only one piece of the optimization. It's really about process technology, packaging. We're leading sort of the usage of chiplets and 2.5D and 3D integration and then when you go to architecture and design. So, it's really the holistic product. And from a pricing standpoint, actually, price is only one aspect of the conversation. Much of the conversation is on how much performance can you give me at what efficiency. So, from a -- from an overall efficiency standpoint, I think we've developed fantastic products. We are working closely with our customers to ensure that we continue to evolve our overall portfolio. So, I think from a value-added standpoint, it's providing the best TCO is what our customers are looking for, and that's where our road map is headed.

There's a lot of excitement around AI, and we are very much clear that that is the No. 1 priority from a growth standpoint going forward. But the EPYC CPU business, we feel like we've consistently gained share throughout the last few years. And even with that, we're still underrepresented in large portions of the market, right? We're underrepresented in enterprise. We've seen some nice sort of sequential growth and nice prospects there, but there's a lot more we can do in enterprise. And we're still underrepresented in cloud third-party workloads, which, again, it's a -- you have to sell through the cloud manufacturers.

I know you said double digits. But is that right? And if that is true, especially for Embedded, what does that mean going forward into next year? I know you said it's going to be weak in the first half. Does that mean -- I mean, is it stable at these levels or does it continue to decline through the first half until things stabilize?

Sure, Stacy. Let me take that and then Jean might add a few comments. So, without getting very specific, I would say I think your comments about Data Center and Client are correct. And then from an Embedded and Gaming standpoint, we would say Embedded, think about it down similar levels sort of in the teens compared to sort of Q3 was down in the teens and Q4 will be down in the teens. And then Gaming, from a console standpoint, we do expect that to be down a bit more than that. And then as we go into Q1, again without being -- there are lots of things that need to happen. We would expect that both gaming and embedded would be down into Q1 as well and sort of the other comments would be more around seasonality. Does that help?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

For my follow-up, again, I wanted to ask about gross margins. So, I know that they've been extending through the year, but for the full year, they're actually down. And I get the mix things and everything else. But as I look into next year, like how do I think about this because it sounds like Embedded is going to be pretty weak next year. Client is what it is. Data Center is growing but it does feel like even if the GPUs are accretive, they're not accretive yet, and it's going to take them a while to get to be accretive. Like how much do you think you can expand gross margins year over year like in '24  versus '23, given the trends that we have entering the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

Stacy, I'll say the first thing is if you look at 2023, it's a very unusual year for the industry, right, especially the PC market. It's one of the worst down cycles during the last three decades. So, during that kind of a down cycle, definitely, we had headwinds on gross margin side, on our Client business, which we have made significant progress in Q3 and Q4 in second half. Going into next year, the mix primarily is the driver of our gross margin. The way to think about it is Data Center is going to be the largest incremental revenue contributor next year. And then with both Gaming and Embedded facing continued sequential decline, I think it's all about the mix. We do expect next year will improve gross margin versus 2023, especially second half. So, that's how we think about it right now. Operator And our final question comes from the line of Christopher Rolland with Susquehanna.

There was an article suggesting that you guys could be interested in doing some ARM-based CPUs. I guess I'd love any thoughts that you have there on that architecture for PC. But also Apple has their M3 out now. It seems pretty robust. Qualcomm has an X Elite new chip. It was rumored NVIDIA might be doing that as well. Would love your expectations for this market.

Sure, Chris. Thanks for the question. So, look, the way we think about ARM, ARM is a partner in many respects so we use ARM throughout parts of our portfolio. I think as it relates to PCs, x86 is still the majority of the volume in PCs. And if you think about sort of the ecosystem around x86 and Windows, I think it's been a very robust ecosystem. What I'm most excited about in PCs is actually the AI PC. I think the AI PC opportunity is an opportunity to redefine what PCs are in terms of productivity tool and really sort of operating on sort of user data. And so, I think we're at the beginning of a wave there. We're investing heavily in Ryzen AI and the opportunity to really broaden sort of the AI capabilities of PCs going forward. And I think that's where the conversation is going to be about. It's going to be less about what instructions that you're using and more about what experience are you delivering to customers. And from that standpoint, I think that we have a very exciting portfolio that I feel good about over the next couple of years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/10/31/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2023-earnings-call-t/

I mean, Chris, the way I think about sort of FPGAs in the data center, it's another compute element. We do use FPGAs or there are FPGAs in a number of the systems. I would say from a revenue contribution standpoint, it's still relatively small sort of in the near term. We have some design wins going forward that we would see that content grow but that won't be so much in 2024, that will be beyond that. And part of our value proposition, I think, to our data center partners is, look, whatever compute element you need, whether it's CPUs or GPUs or FPGAs or DPUs or -- we have the ability to sort of bring those components together. And that is a strong point as we think about just how heterogeneous these data centers are going forward. So, thank you for that.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,1,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Yes. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my questions, and congrats on the results. I guess, Lisa, my first question is around the data center business. I think we're all, across the industry, observing a shift in workload and spending patterns like maybe we've, arguably, never seen. And your company is in a great position to participate on both sides of that on the CPU strength, and obviously in the AI space. Last quarter, you had given us some metrics around potentially being able to grow your data center business by 50% in the second half of the year versus the first half. And maybe you could give us a little bit of an update on how you're thinking about that milestone and the drivers of growth across CPU and accelerator for the back half? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Matt. Thanks for the question. So, you're absolutely right. It's a very dynamic market right now in the data center. We certainly see -- let me go through some of the pieces. So, on the positive side, we certainly see that acceleration of AI demand. From our standpoint, we see it in a couple of ways. We have a number of design wins in AI deployments as the CPU that goes with GPUs, as well as other accelerators. So, in the head nodes, we've seen that positive on the CPU side. We've also seen some strong interest in our MI250 accelerator, which is currently shipping right now. And we see very strong pull on the MI300 accelerators that are starting production in the fourth quarter. So, those are the positive market dynamics as we go into the second half of the year. We also see some of the softer cloud spend that is happening outside of AI as some of the cloud vendors are optimizing their capex. And enterprise, I would say, is still on the weaker side. But with all that in place, we are expecting a large ramp in second half for our data center business and weighted toward the fourth quarter. And we are still looking at a zip code of, let's call it, 50% plus or minus second half to first half. So, it's a big ramp, but when we look at all the components, I think that the customer pull is certainly there. And it's exciting to be in this part of the industry.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,company,"-- Thank you for that, Lisa. I guess as my follow-up, still sticking with the Data center business. Your company is aggressively trying to ramp both the hardware and the software side of the MI300 programs to support AI. There's been some conflicting reports as to whether all of those deployments are time. I think you've, in the prepared script, said what you guys think about that. I guess my question is really around the software work and the hardware itself that you're doing with your lead customers. Maybe you could give a little bit about, firstly, how the customer feedback has been on the performance of the hardware itself and, secondly, how you think the software work you're doing with your lead customers will translate into other customer deployments as we work through next year. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, absolutely. So, if I give you just some color on how the customer engagements are going, there's very strong customer interest across the board in our AI solutions, that includes, let's call it, multiple Tier 1 hyperscalers that we're engaged with. It includes some large enterprises. And it also includes this new category of some of these AI-centric companies that are sort of very forward-looking in terms of how they're deploying and building AI solutions. So, from that aperture, we made a lot of progress with our ROCm software stack. I'm actually -- there is a lot more to do, but I would say the progress that we've made has been significant. We're getting lots of feedback from those lead customers. We're seeing the benefits of the optimization, so working also on the higher-level model frameworks, the work that we're doing with the PyTorch Foundation, the work that we're doing with Onyx, with Triton. And the key is we're getting significant real-time feedback from some of these lead customers. So, we're learning at a very fast pace. In terms of the feedback on performance, a number of companies have now been able to look at MI250 across a broad range of workloads, and that's a good translation as you go to MI300, and the feedback has been quite positive. We have customers sampling either on our lab systems, they're accessing the hardware, or sampling in their labs. And I would say, so far, very positive. The pull is there. There is a lot of work to be done, but we feel very good about the progress of our overall AI solutions for the data center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking the question. Just building on Matt's comments or question, I just want to go back to the implied revenue for the data center business for the back half of the year. Jean, I think, last quarter, you had alluded to, for the full year, the expectation is still growing 10% or double digits, I should say, for the full year, the data center business, just confirming that. And what I'm really trying to ask is, given the guidance of flat year-over-year growth in data center in 3Q, it would seem, if my math is correct, you're implying a 50% or so increase sequentially into 4Q. I'm just trying to frame exactly how you're thinking about the cadence of what 4Q looks like, underpinning that expectation.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. I think as Lisa just mentioned earlier, it's a very dynamic market. There are puts and takes. We have a tremendously strong momentum with our product portfolio, but there is continued softness in enterprise market, and also call it, the optimization is still ongoing. So, overall, on balance, we think year over year, it's probably more like a high single digit.

So, we have been really investing in our supply chain, the data center growth is so strategic to us, that this has been part of the strategy. So, if you look at all aspects of the supply chain, from the wafers to the backend capacity, to some of the specific components that you need to do something of the class of MI300, we've worked with the entire supply chain. We feel that we have ample supply for an aggressive ramp in the fourth quarter and into 2024.

Thank you so much for taking the question. My first one is on the data center business as well. And I just wanted to follow up on the Q3 to Q4 dynamic. And I do apologize if I missed this, but in the implied growth rate in data center in Q4, can you speak to what percentage of supercomputing? I think there is a big project that's slated to ship in Q4. And is there any contribution from the Instinct series outside of supercomputing as well or is it primary your server CPU franchise?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, as Jean said, into the third quarter, we expect double-digit sequential growth in data center, that's primarily EPYC. So, that's primarily the Zen 4, let's call it the combination of Genoa and Bergamo, as that continues to ramp. As we go into the fourth quarter, there is an implied significant ramp in revenue. I think there are multiple components to that. So, there is -- the server CPU side will continue to ramp as we see Zen 4 ramp. There is a sort of large, call it, lumpy supercomputer win, so our El Capitan win will be in the fourth quarter primarily, with a little bit in the first quarter. And then we will have contribution from both MI300X going to large AI customers as they start their initial ramps, as well as MI250s with a number of customers who have now -- view that as a very good option for some of the workloads that are not necessarily the largest language models or the largest parameters, but let's call it more sort of the other AI workload. So, those are the components of the fourth quarter implied growth. Lots of pieces to it, but clearly, a big piece of it is the MI300 ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thank you, Lisa. And then shifting gears a little bit and follow-up question on the client side. You talked about the business returning to profitability in Q3, which is great. But you're still well below where you were in '21 and '22 from an operating margin perspective. Can you speak to the competitive landscape in the client business? Is there a path back to, call it, 20%, 30% operating margins there? And do you have any cost initiatives ongoing to get you back to that level of profitability in client?

Maybe let me start, and then maybe Jean can add some comment. So, look, I think the PC business has been fairly volatile over the last number of quarters, from the pandemic highs to some of the inventory digestion that we were all dealing with. I can say that I'm pleased to say that I think the growth that we're seeing -- that we saw during the second quarter and that we see in the second half is the strength of our product portfolio. I think the Ryzen 7000 series is doing well, there's good customer pull. I think from a competitive dynamic standpoint, the business is always competitive, but we feel good about. The most important thing that was a little bit of a drag on operating margins was the revenue being low, as well as some of the -- we had a case where the sell-in was below consumption as we were normalizing inventory levels in the supply chain. As we get past that, what we see is I think the client business continues to grow. We believe that client will grow into 2024 as well. In terms of some of the cost initiatives, we have been, let's call it, optimizing sort of the overall R&D footprint, but maybe I'll let Jean comment some more.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

On the opex side, the team has done a great job during this process to really optimize the investment in client, on the segment to be more efficient and effective. If you look at the overall common company level, our opex has been largely flattish. But we are investing in AI, data center, and the strategic priorities we have which generate a much higher return on investment. So, we have optimized it.

The first one, just a clarification, would it be reasonable to assume that your GPU accelerator sales could be about, say, $500-ish million this year, so about 7%, 8% of data center sales? And if that is the right number, does it mean your server CPU sales are effectively flattish year on year this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,26,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Vivek, I don't know that I would go into quite that granularity. What we will say is the GPU sales in the first half of the year were very low as we were sort of in a product transition timing as we go into the second half of the year. In particular, the fourth quarter, we'll have MI300 ramp. I think your number may be a little bit high in terms of the GPU sales, but overall, in general, I think our expectation is that, as Jean said, the data center business, given all of the market dynamics, we see it up high single digits year on year, we see much better second half compared to first half. And I think the product portfolio and the ramp of Genoa and Bergamo, as well as the ramp of MI300 are key components of the second-half ramp.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, just kind of a broader question on AI accelerators in the commercial market, so I'm excluding the Supercomputing, the El Capitan projects, etc. What is AMD's specific edge in this market? You know there are already strong and established kind of merchant players, there are a number of ASIC options, a number of your traditional competitors, Intel and others, and several start-ups are also ramping. So, my question is, what is AMD's specific niche in this market? What is your value proposition and how sustainable is it? Because you're just starting to sample the product now. So, I'm trying to get some realistic sense of how big it can be and what the specific kind of niche and differentiation is for AMD in this market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,28,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Vivek. So, I think maybe let me take a step back and just talk about sort of our investments in AI. So, our investments in AI are very broad and I know there's a lot of interest around data center, but I don't want us to lose track of the investments on the edge as well as in the client. But to your question on what is our value proposition in the data center, I think what we have shown is that we have very strong capability with supercomputing, as you've mentioned. And then, as you look at AI, there are many different types of AI. If you look across training and inference, sort of the largest language models, and what drives some of the performance in there when we look at MI300, MI300 is actually designed to be a highly flexible family of products that looks across all of these different segments. And in particular, where we've seen a lot of interest is in the sort of large language model inference. So, MI300X has the highest memory bandwidth, has the highest memory capacity. And if you look at that inference workload, it's actually a very -- it's very dependent on those things. That being said, we also believe that we have a very strong value proposition and training as well. When you look across those workloads and the investments that we're making, not just today, but going forward with our next generation MI400 series and so on and so forth, we definitely believe that we have a very competitive and capable hardware roadmap. I think the discussion about AMD, frankly, has always been about the software roadmap, and we do see a bit of a change here on the software side. Number one, we've put a tremendous amount of resource on it. So, bringing together our former Xilinx software team, together with the AMD sort of based software team, we've dramatically increased the resources. And also, the focus has now been on sort of optimizing at these higher-level models. So, if you think about the frameworks around PyTorch and Triton and Onyx, I think many of the new AI-centric companies are actually optimizing at a different level, and they're working very closely with us. So, in this place where AI is tremendously exciting, I think there will be multiple winners. And we will be first to say that there are multiple winners. But we think our portfolio is actually fairly unique in the sense that we do have CPUs, GPUs, we have the accelerator technology with Ryzen AI on the PC side as well as in the embedded side with our Xilinx portfolio. So, I think it's a pretty broad and capable portfolio.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,30,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to first go back to the Q4 data center guide. So, if I do my math right, it's something like $700 million sequentially in data center from Q3 to Q4. So, how much of that is MI300 versus CPU? And given the lumpiness of the El Capitan piece, what does that imply for the potential seasonality into Q1 as most of it rolls off?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,31,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So, it is a large ramp, Stacy, into the fourth quarter. I think the largest piece of that is the MI300 ramp. But there is also a significant component that's just the EPYC processor ramp with, as I said, the Zen 4 portfolio. In terms of the lumpiness of the revenue and where it goes into 2024. Let me give you kind of a few pieces. So, I think there was a question earlier about how much of the MI300 revenue was AI-centric versus let's call it supercomputing centric. The larger piece is supercomputing, but it's meaningful revenue contribution from AI. As we go into 2024, our expectation is again, let me go back to the customer interest on MI300X is very high. There are a number of customers that are looking to deploy as quickly as possible. So, we would expect early deployments as we go into the first half of 2024, and then we would expect more volume in the second half of '24 as those things fully qualify. So, it is going to be a little bit lumpy as we get through the next few quarters. But our visibility is such that there are multiple customers that are looking to deploy as soon as possible. And we're working very closely with them to do the co-engineering necessary to get them ramped.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

For my follow-up, just gross margins coming up in the back in the second. I mean, they still kind of missed in the quarter. I know they rounded up to 50%, but they were 49.7%. I know you're guiding 51 for Q3. Jean, where do you see gross margins sitting like in Q4 as we exit the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,35,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Yeah. I think the gross margin is, for us, the primary driver as we discussed in the past, it's really mixed. And if you look at our guidance or outlook of Q3, gross margin of 51%, it's more than one percentage point improvement sequentially despite of very significant headwind from embedded business declining in Q3. So, the data center and the client business are expected to grow double-digit sequentially and provide a positive impact on the gross margins, which actually more than offset the headwind from embedded business. So, going to Q4, again we're not guiding Q4 and it's going to depend on mix. I would say one thing is you will have similar dynamics, right? Data centers expect to grow very significantly. At the same time, we're going to have the same headwind from embedded business declining sequentially. So, overall, we do expect gross margin to improve from this level going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, look, when I look at the embedded business, I think we should start by remembering that we're coming off of six quarters of very strong growth. I mean, this business has performed extremely well, and very pleased with the overall momentum in the business. To your exact question of what we're seeing in the markets, we're actually seeing the core markets hold up pretty well, so let's call it aerospace and defense strong; industrial vision and healthcare, strong; test and emulation strong. We are seeing communications weakness. So, that is the primary driver of the second-half commentary. And there's also some inventory optimization, as you might expect, since our league times have come down over the last several months. So, in terms of zip code, I would say think of it as double-digit down sequentially in the third quarter, and that's the current view that we have. But overall, the business has been extremely strong for us, so I think this is an expected decline as we come off the cycle.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Tim, thanks for the question. I think as we ramp those product lines in Q3 and Q4, you will see inventory come down first in Q3 and Q4 again. I think the inventory days of inventory probably will be around 110 to 120 days. The key thing is, right, is if you look at a lot of our product, they are like advanced process technology, five-nanometer, four-nanometer, six. The manufacturing cycle tends to be long. So, in the longer term, you should expect us from days of inventory be more around 100 to 120 days versus traditionally like 80 days or 75 days. That will be too short for, really, most advanced process technologies.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then my follow-up is for you, Lisa. I mean, if you kind of add up the units, the customer interest, you can easily get to several hundred thousand units, it seems to me, for the MI300X next year. So, the question really is on the supply chain, and particularly Cohost, do you think that's going to be a bottleneck for you? I know that, you know, they've been expanding capacity. I know you've been trying to procure more there. Can you sort of talk about that and sort of do you think that supply could become a limiting factor you next year?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,45,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely. So, I'm not going to comment on the exact units, but what I will say is that we've been focused on the supply chain for MI300 for quite some time. It is tight. There's no question that it's tight in the industry. However, we have sort of commitments for significant capacity across the entire supply chain. So, co-host is one piece of it, high bandwidth memory is another piece of it and then just the general capacity requirements and look, our goal is to make this a significant growth driver for AMD, I think it's a great market opportunity. We love the engagements with customers, it's our responsibility to provide the supply for the demand and so that's what we've been working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And more on the MI300 opportunity that you guys called out as a multibillion-dollar growth opportunity.

Have you looked at the performance? How do they perform? Are you excited about that? And then, in terms of hyperscale uptake, is it the X version, the GPU-only version, that you expect to be the biggest seller here?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,49,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, there were a lot of aspects to that question, Chris. So, let me try to give you some framework here. I don't think we're ready to talk about timing yet of revenue numbers. What we will say is we do believe it's a multibillion-dollar opportunity. I think 2024 is a very important year for us. Ramping MI300 in multiple customers over the next several quarters is very important. I think I mentioned earlier in the Q&A that the customer interest is actually diverse, which is great. It includes sort of what you would expect in terms of the large Tier 1 hyperscalers. But I think these new class of sort of AI-focused companies have been working very closely with us, and then some of the large enterprises are also looking at ramping up their efforts. The performance that we see is strong. I think the large language model work that we've done, we've done a lot of it on MI250, and we've seen very good results that's on both training as well as inference. I think as we go through MI300 again, the early results are strong. For AI applications, what we're seeing now is MI300X. So, let's call it the GPU-only version is the one that is sort of most prevalent in the AI customer engagement. But the MI300A, actually, which is sort of where we have the CPU and the GPU more closely coupled together is also of interest. So, I think the key is I think we've built a platform that does allow people to kind of choose what is best for the models and for the workloads that they're trying to enable. And that's what we're working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

I think Siena fits again. It's as you said, it's a niche that we haven't previously been focused on. I think our interactions with the telco suppliers are they're anxious to have Siena be a part of their portfolio. Siena is also one that we'll use for other edge applications, or let's call it lower-end applications that need the performance of Zen 4, but perhaps not the heavy platform that we have on the Genoa and Bergamo.

Let me just make sure I get the statement clear. So, both MI300A and MI300X will be part of the ramp, particularly in the fourth quarter. And as we go into next year for the AI-specific applications, we are more heavily weighted toward MI300X, just given sort of where the software is written. And to your question about gross margins at the corporate level, so we would expect that our AI business will be accretive to gross margins at the corporate level. And obviously, as you start the ramp, there's a little bit of learning, but overall, we expect it to be accretive to our corporate gross margins.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then for my follow-up, I just had, I guess, clarification. So, it sounds like most of the MI revenue you have in the hopper right now for at least the committed revenue is LCAP. Is that true? And do you have other, I guess, confirmed or hard orders for that, or maybe just spend some time telling us how you're working with the customers or what it takes for them to go from, ""Hey, we are interested,"" to, ""Here is the purchase order?""",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

So, maybe if your question is do we have other customers who are committed to MI300 other than LCAP, the answer is yes. We have a number of customers who are actually committed. And the way these things go, actually it's not different, not very different than how a server ramp goes, right? I mean, one starts with an initial deployment, ensures that the software works, ensures that we have all of the reliability and capability in the data center, and then they ramp from that. I will say the difference in AI deployments is, I think, customers are willing to go very quickly. There is sort of a desire and agility because we all want to accelerate the amount of AI compute that's out there. And so, the speed in which customers are engaged and customers are making decisions is actually faster than they would in sort of a normal, sort of regular environment. And that's great.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,61,Harsh Kumar,Piper Sandler -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask the question. And Lisa, we are looking forward to an exciting second half for your company. I had a quick question on the server share. Do you think that there is a theoretical limit to the share that AMD can get? Historically initially we heard 80-20 was a pervading rule, and then you busted through that. Now, we are hearing customers say 70-30 is more like it. More importantly, are there any large vendors for your server business where you have significantly more than 30% share, let's say, 40% or even 50% share? And I have a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. Look, in the server business, I think the most important thing for our customers is that we have a strong roadmap, and it's a roadmap that they can count on. And we've been building that sort of working model, that roadmap, and the trust over the past four or five years. So, I don't think there is any theoretical cap on AMD share. I would say, if we look today, there are multiple customers who have us deployed in their data centers more than 50% share. And from our view, the place where we have perhaps been a bit more underrepresented is in the enterprise. And that's just a matter of sort of the breadth of enterprise customers and the breadth of enterprise software. So, we believe that we have leadership today, and we are very, very focused on ensuring that we continue leadership in the market. And with that, there is an opportunity to continue to gain share in the server market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

On my second one, can you help us think a little bit about the generative AI spend, let's say, if you can side press some kind of metric, and so, how many dollars of spend today are you seeing from your customers on generative AI for let's say each dollar of regular server CPU spend? Is there a metric that we can think of? Is there a trend today?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 1, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,64,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Harsh, the best way to answer that, and again, we are all sort of -- it's all on crystal ball as to what's going to happen over the next four or five years. There is no question that the demand for generative AI solutions is very high, and there is a lot of compute capacity that needs to put in. The way we size the market is, it can perhaps grow at a rate of, let's call it 50% CAGR plus or minus over the next three or four years. So, that would take us to $150 billion by the time we get to 2027. Now, that's all accelerators in the data centers, so that includes GPUs, that includes other ASICs and other accelerators. But I think we have an opportunity to address a large portion of that market. So, that makes it very clear priority for us. It's our No. 1 strategic priority, and we will continue to work closely with our customers as they optimize between CPU and GPU or spend.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,1,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for the question. For my first one, Lisa, when I look at your full-year Data Center outlook for some growth, that implicitly suggest Data Center, right, could be up 30% in the second half versus the first half, right? And I'm curious, what is your confidence and visibility and some of the assumptions that go into that view? Is it -- do you think there is a much bigger ramp in the new products? Is it enterprise recovery? Is it pricing? So just give us a sense for how we should think about the confidence and visibility of the strong ramp that is implied in your second-half Data Center outlook?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Right. So, Vivek, thanks for the question. Maybe let me give you some context on what's going on in the Data Center right now. First of all, we have said that it's a mixed environment in the Data Center. So the first half of the year, there are some of the larger cloud customers that are working through some inventory and optimization as well as a weaker enterprise. As we go into the second half of the year, we see a couple of things. First, our road map is very strong. So the feedback that we're getting working with our customers on, it's ramping well. It is very differentiated in terms of TCO and overall performance. So we think it's very well-positioned. Much of the work that we've done in the first half of the year -- in the first quarter and here in the second quarter is to ensure that we complete all of that work such that we can ramp across a broader set of workloads as we go into the second half of the year. And then I would say, from an overall market standpoint, I think enterprise will still be mixed with the notion that we expect some improvement. It depends a little bit on the macro situation. And then as we go into the second half of the year, in addition to Genoa, we're also ramping Bergamo. So that's on track to launch here in the second quarter and will ramp in the second half of the year. And then as we get toward the end of the year, we also have our GPU ramp of MI300. So with that, we start the ramp in the fourth quarter of our supercomputing wins as well as our early cloud AI wins. So those are all the factors. Of course, we'll have to see how the the year play about how we're positioned from an overall product and road map standpoint for Data Center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,3,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- All right. And for my follow-up, Lisa, how do you see the market share evolve in the Data Center in the second half? Do you think that the competitive gap between your and your competitors' products, has that narrowed? Or you still think that in the second half, you have a chance to gain market share in the Data Center?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Absolutely, Vivek. Well, I mean, we've gained share nicely over the last four years. When you look at our Data Center progression, it's actually been pretty steady. As we go into the second half of this year, I think we continue to believe that we have a very strong competitive position. So we do think that positions us well to gain share. In the conversations that we're having with customers, I think they're enthusiastic about Zen 4 and what it can bring into cloud workloads as well as enterprise workloads. I think actually Genoa is extremely well-positioned for enterprise where we have been underrepresented. So we feel good about the road map. I mean, obviously, it's competitive, but we feel very good about our ability to continue to gain share.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the Embedded business. It's been a really strong business for you since the acquisition of Xilinx, you're guiding the business down sequentially in Q2. Is this sort of the macro/cycle kicking in? Or is it something supply related? If you can kind of expand on the Q2 outlook there and your expectations for the second half, that would be helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Absolutely, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. I mean I think the Embedded business has performed extremely well over the last four or five quarters. Q1 was another record for the Embedded business. When we look underneath it, there is a broad set of market segments that we have exposure to, and the majority of them are actually doing very well. Our thought process for sort of modest decline into Q2 is that we did have a bunch of backlog that we're in the process of clearing and that backlog will clear in Q2, and then we expect that the growth will moderate a bit. We still very much like the positioning of sort of our aerospace and defense, our industrial, our test and emulation business our automotive business. We expect wireless trends to be a little bit weaker as well as consumer trends. So those are the kind of the puts and takes in the market. But I would say the business has performed well above our expectations.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, maybe one for Jean on the gross margin side of things. In your slide deck, I think you're guiding gross margins up half over half in the second half. Can you maybe speak to the puts and takes and the drivers as you think about gross margins over the next six to nine months?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thank you for the question. Our gross margin is primarily driven by mix. If you look at the first half -- first-quarter performance and second-quarter guide, we are very pleased with the strong gross margin performance in both the Data Center and the embedded segment. We haven't been seeing headwinds from a Client segment impacting our gross margin. Going to the second half, we do expect gross margin improvement because Data Center is going up and the Embedded continue to be relatively strong. The pace of improvement in the second half actually will be largely dependent on the Client segment. We think the Client segment gross margin is also going to improve. But overall, it's going to be below corporate average. So the pace of improvement of gross margin could be dependent on the pace for the Client business recovery in second half. But in the longer term, right, when we look at our business opportunities, the largest incremental revenue opportunities are going to come from Data Center and Embedded segment. So we are building very good about longer-term gross margin going up continuously.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,11,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I've got two as well. I guess the first question going back on just like the cadence of the server CPU cycle with Genoa and Bergamo. And I think it's great to hear that you guys are on track to launch Bergamo here. But there's been some discussion here throughout this last quarter around some DDR5 challenges. I think there's PMEC issues. I'm just curious of how you -- if those issues have presented themselves or how you would characterize the cadence of the ramp cycle of Genoa at this point?,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,12,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Aaron. So yes, look, I think Genoa, we always said, as we launched it, that it would be a little bit more of a longer transition compared to Milan because it is a new platform. So it is the new DDR5, it's PCI Gen 5. And for many of our top customers, they're also doing other things other than upgrading the CPUs. So from that standpoint, I would say the ramp is going about as we expected. We've seen a lot of interest, a lot of customer engineering work that we're doing together in the data centers with our customers, we feel great about the set of workloads, and we see expansion in the workloads going forward. So overall, our expectation is, particularly as we go into the second half, we'll see Genoa ramp more broadly. But Genoa and Milan are going to coexist throughout the year, just given sort of the breadth of platforms that we have.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And then I'm curious if my second question just real quick is the MI300, if we look out beyond just the deployment through the course of this year, how do you guys think about success in that data center GPU market to we think about beyond just?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Aaron. So back to the DDR5 question, we haven't seen anything specific on DDR5. And it's just normal platform bring up that we're seeing. Now as it relates to your question about MI300, look, we're really excited about the AI opportunity. I think that is success for us is having a significant part of the AI overall opportunity. AI for us is broader than cloud. I mean it also includes what we're doing in Clients and Embedded. But specifically, as it relates to MI300, MI300 is actually very well-positioned for both HPC or supercomputing workloads as well as for AI workloads. And with the recent interest in generative AI, I would say the pipeline for MI300 has expanded considerably here over the last few months, and we're excited about that. We're putting a lot more resources. I mentioned on the prepared remarks, the work that we're doing, sort of taking our Xilinx and sort of the the overall AMD AI efforts and collapsing them into one organization that's primarily to accelerate our AI software work as well as platform work. So success for MI3100 is for sure, a significant part of sort of the growth in AI in the cloud. And I think we feel good about how we're positioned there.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon, everybody. Lisa, my first question, I think just the way the business has trended, right, with enterprise and with China in the data center market being a bit softer recently, and it seems like that's kind of continuing into the second quarter. It occurs to me that a big percentage of your data center business, particularly in server in the second half of the year is going to be driven by U.S. hyperscale. And I guess my question is the level of visibility you have to unit volumes, to pricing, to timing of ramps. If you could walk us through that a little bit, given it's customer concentrated. I imagine you have some level of visibility. And you mentioned growth for the year-end data center. If you could be a little bit more precise there, that's -- I understand there's market dynamics, but it's a bit of a big comment and helps to just push me to ask about quantifying the growth for the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Matt, thanks for the question. So look, I think as we work with our largest cloud customers in the Data Center segment, particularly with our EPYC CPUs, we have very good conversations in terms of what their ramp plans are, what their qualification plans are, which workloads, which instances. So I feel that we have good visibility. Obviously, some of this is still dependent on overall macro situation and overall demand. But our view is that there is a lot of good progress in the Data Center. Now in terms of quantification, as I said, there's a lot of puts and takes. My view is that enterprise will improve as we go into the second half, and we're even seeing, I would say, some very early signs of some improvement in China as well. So our view is, I think, double-digit Data Center growth is what we currently see. And certainly, we would like to ramp Genoa and Bergamo as a large piece given the strength of those products, we'd like to see them grow share here over the next couple of quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,18,Matt Ramsey,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Lisa, that's helpful. For my follow-up question, I think in the prepared scripts, we're obviously under-shipping sell-through to clear the channel in the Client business in the first half of the year. And I think the language that was used was seasonal improvements in the second half. So are you guys expecting to come back to shipping in line with sell-through so to stop under-shipping demand? And then for on top of that seasonal improvements in the market? Or -- and if you could just kind of help me think about the magnitude and the moving pieces in Client for the second half?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So we've been under-shipping sort of consumption in the Client business for about three quarters now. And certainly, our goal has been to normalize the inventory in the supply chain so that shipments would be closer to consumption. We expect that, that will happen in the second half of the year, and that's what the comment meant that we believe that there will be improvements in the overall inventory positioning. And then we also believe that the client market is stabilizing. So Q1 was the bottom for our business as well as for the overall market. From what we see although it will be a gradual set of improvements, we do see that the overall market should be better in the second half of the year. We like our product portfolio a lot. I'm excited about having AI-enabled on our Ryzen 7000 series. And we have leadership notebook platforms with Dragon Range. Our desktop road map is also quite strong with our new launch of the Verizon 7000 X3D products. And so I think here in the second quarter, we'll still under-ship consumption a bit. And by the second half of the year, we should be more normalized between shipments and consumption, and we expect some seasonal improvement into the second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Joe, this is a bit harder because every customer is different. What we're seeing is different customers are at a different place in their sort of overall cycle. But let me say it this way though. I think we have good visibility with all of our large customers in terms of what they're trying to do for the quarter, for the year. Obviously, some of that will depend on how the macro plays out. But from our viewpoint, I think we're also going through a product transition between Milan and Genoa and some of these workloads. So if you put all those things into the conversation, that's why our comment was that we will -- we do believe that the second quarter will grow modestly and then there'll be more growth in the second half of the year as it relates to the Data Center business. So there lots of puts and takes, every customers in a bit of a different cycle. But overall, the number of workloads that they're going to be using AMD on, we believe, will expand as we go through the next few quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

We mentioned in the prepared remarks some of the work that was done on the LUMI supercomputer with generative AI models. We've continued to do quite a bit of library optimization with MI250 and software optimization to really ensure that we could increase the overall performance and capabilities. MI300 looks really good. I think from everything that we see, the workloads have also changed a bit in terms of -- whereas a year ago, much of the conversation was primarily focused on training. Today, that has migrated to sort of large language model inferencing, which is particularly good for GPUs. So I think from an MI300 standpoint, we do believe that we will start ramping revenue in the fourth quarter with cloud AI customers and then it will be more meaningful in 2024.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Good to see the strong dynamics in Embedded, very diverse end markets. And given their strong market share position here, the Valens team is in a really good position to catalyze EPYC attach or Ryzen attached to their FPGA and adaptive compute solutions, right? I think embedded x86 is like a $6 billion to $8 billion per year market opportunity. So, Lisa, given you're a year with Xilinx in the portfolio, can you just give us an update on the synergy unlock and driving higher AMD compute attached to Xilinx sockets?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Thanks, Harlan. It's a great question. The Xilinx portfolio has done extremely well with us. Very strong, I would say, we continue to get more content attached to the FPGAs and the adaptive SoCs. We have seen the beginnings of good traction with the cross-selling and that is opportunity to take both Ryzen and EPYC CPUs into the broader embedded market. I think the customers are very open to that. I think we have a sales force and a go-to-market capability across this customer set that is very helpful for that. So I do believe that this is a long-term opportunity for us to continue to grow our embedded business. And we've already seen some design wins as a result of the the combination of the Xilinx portfolio and the AMD portfolio, and I think we'll see a lot more of that going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

And in terms of other opportunities, there appears to be this trend toward more of your cloud and hyperscale customers opting to do their own silicon solutions around accelerated compute or AI offload ends, right? And if I look at it right, there are less than a handful of the world semiconductor companies that have the compute, graphics, connectivity IP portfolio that you guys have as well as the capabilities to design these very complex offload SoCs, right? Does the team have a strategy to try and go after some of the semi-custom or full-blown ASIC-based hyperscale programs?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- We do, Harlan, and I would put it more broadly. And the more -- the broader point is, I think we have a very complete IP portfolio across CPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, adaptive SoCs, DPUs, and a very capable semi-custom team. And so beyond hyperscalers, I think when we look at sort of higher volume opportunities, we think there are higher volume opportunities beyond game consoles that there are custom opportunities available. So I think that combination of IP is very helpful. I think it's a long-term opportunity for us, and it's one of the areas where we think we can add value to our largest customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I just want to talk about the pricing environment in a general sense. You guys have done a great job of increasing the benefits to your customers and being able to raise prices, pass along cost increases, those sorts of things. But the competitive intensity and the weakness in the market, at least currently seems to -- that it could work against that. So in the near term and then perhaps exiting this year into the next couple of years, can you just talk about where you think pricing is going to go across both your Data Center market, most importantly, but then also in your Client market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Ross, what I would say is a couple of things. I think in the Data Center market, the pricing is relatively stable. And what that comes from is -- our goal is to add more capability, right? So it's a TCO equation where as we're going from Milan to Genoa, we are adding more cores, more performance. And the performance per dollar that we offer to our customers is one where it's advantageous for them to adopt our technologies and our solutions. So I expect that. I think in the Client business, given some of the inventory conditions in there, I think there's -- it's a more competitive environment. We're all -- from my standpoint, we're focused on normalizing the inventory levels. And with that normalization, the most important thing is to ensure that we get the shipments more in line with consumption because I think that's a healthier business environment overall. And then, again, it's back to product values, right? So we have to ensure that our products continue to offer superior performance per dollar, performance per watt capabilities in the market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

I just wanted to know what you would describe as your competitive advantages? Everybody knows that's a market that's exploding right now. There's tons of demand. You guys have all the IP to be able to attack it. But there's a very large incumbent in that space as well. So when you think about what AMD can bring to the market, whether it's hardware, software, heterogeneity of the products you can bring, etc., what do you think is the core competitive advantage that can allow you to penetrate that market successfully?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,34,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. There's a couple of aspects, Ross. And -- yes, since we haven't yet announced MI300, all of the specifications will -- some of those will come over the coming quarters. MI300 is the first solution that has both the CPU and GPU together, and that has been very positive for the supercomputing market. I think as it relates to generative AI, and we think we have a very strong value proposition from both a hardware and again, it's a performance per dollar conversation, I think there's a lot of demand in the market. And there's also -- I think given our deep customer relationships on the EPYC side, there's actually a lot of synergy between the customer set between the EPYC CPUs and the sort of 300 GPU customers. So I think when we look at all these together, our view is that demand is strong for AI. And I think our position is also very strong given there are very, very few products that can really satisfy these large language model sort of needs. And I think we feel confident that we can do that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,37,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Tim, I think the answer is yes. I think we have made significant progress even over the last year in terms of our software capabilities. And the way you should think about our AI portfolio is it's really a broad AI portfolio across client sort of edge as well as cloud. And with that, I think the Xilinx team brings a lot of background and capability, especially in inference. We've added significant talent in our AI software as well. And the beauty of particularly the cloud opportunity is it's not that many customers, and it's not that many workloads. So when you have sort of very clear customer targets, we're working very, very closely with our customers on optimizing for a handful of workloads that generate significant volume. That gives us a very clear target for what winning is in the market. So we feel good about our opportunities in AI. And I'd like to say that it's a multiyear journey.

If I look at just your report versus what Intel reported on a Q-over-Q basis, it clearly on a year-over-year basis, you have gained share.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,56,Jean Hu,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer and Treasurer",company,"-- Yeah, Stacy. That's a good question. The way to think about it is if you look at our Q1 gross margins and the Q2 guide around 50%. And as you know, both our Data Center and Embedded have a very strong gross margin performance. And so what the headwinds that impact our gross margin is really PC client on the side, which, as we talked about, is we are shipping significantly under the consumption and also to digest inventory in the downstream supply chain. As you know, typically, that's the time you get a significant pressure on the ASP side and on the funding side, that's why our gross margin in the Client segment has been challenged. In second half, we know it's going to be normalized. That's very important fact is when you normalize the demand and the supply, and we continue to plan a very competitive environment, so don't get us wrong on that front. But it will be better because you are not digesting the inventory, the channel funding, everything, those kind of price reduction will be much less. So we do think the second half will side, the gross margin will be better than first half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business.

And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it.

That's a good question. I think when you look at the year over year, you're absolutely right. Revenue is largely flattish, but operating margin dropped significantly. There are two major drivers. The first is we have increased the investment significantly, especially in networking and AI. As you may recall, we closed the Pensando last May or June. So this is the full quarter for Pensando expenses versus last year. Plus we also increased GPU investment under AI investment. That's all under the Data Center bucket. Secondly, I mentioned about product mix. Lisa said year-over-year cloud sales grew double digits significantly and enterprise actually declined.

Thank you for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question. I wanted to ask you about your views on the inferencing market for generative AI 3+. Specifically, I wanted to ask because I think there's some cross currents going on. We're hearing that CPUs are the best way to do inferencing, but then we're hearing the timeliness of CPUs is not there as a function to be able to enable these kind of instances. So I was curious what you guys think. And then I had a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 2, 2023","March 31, 2023.",1,70,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I think, Harsh, if you were saying -- I mean, I think today, inference is used a lot. CPUs are used a lot for inference. Now where the demand is highest right now is for generative AI and large language model inferencing, you need GPUs to have the horsepower to train sort of the most sophisticated model. So I think those are the two, as you say, crosscurrents. I think inference becomes a much more important workload just given the adoption rate of AI across the board. And I think we'll see that for smaller tasks on CPUs, but for the larger tasks on GPUs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2023-earnings-call-t/

We're doing quite a bit of work with large customers on MI300. And what we're seeing is very positive results.

Thank you very much. Good afternoon. First of all, congratulations, Jean. And congrats as well to Devinder. I mean, the last five years of the company have been remarkable, but I remember all the work you and your finance team did six or seven years ago to keep the foundation stable for what's happened since. So enjoy the retirement. My first question, Lisa, is just about the drivers of 2023. You guys talked in the prepared script about all the different crosscurrents that are kind of going on right now versus the strength of your portfolio versus some inventory digestion in the data center space and obviously, what's going on in the PC market. But I've gotten about a zillion versions of the same question tonight, which was do you think the company can grow for the year 2023 overall? And if you could just kind of walk us through the drivers of the business as we work through the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So there are lots of puts and takes in 2023, and we want to give you kind of some of the drivers. Our largest growth driver is certainly the data center. We are very positioned well with our product portfolio. We just launched our Genoa fourth gen EPYC. We also have Bergamo coming this year as well. When we talk to our cloud customers, what they're telling us is they appreciate the execution of our road map. And we have an opportunity to move more workloads to AMD as we go through the year. So we feel very good about our product positioning. As we mentioned in the prepared remarks, coming off of a very strong 2022, there is some inventory at some of the cloud customers. And so, we are expecting a softer first half and then a stronger second half, but we feel very good about our market share position and opportunity to grow with data center. Also, on the embedded side, I would say we have a very strong portfolio there. The Xilinx business has done very well in 2022. It's a diversified set of markets. We see strength in a number of the end markets. And so, we think that's also a grower for AMD. On the other side, our client and gaming businesses, we believe, will decline. We have made good progress. When we look at the PC markets in the second half of the year of 2022, we were really trying to rebalance inventory, and I think we made progress exiting Q4. We're still expecting to ship below consumption in the first quarter and then sort of go from there. Our product portfolio is strong. We think there's an opportunity for growth as we go into the second half of the year. But we think overall for the year, client will decline just given the TAM. And then on the gaming segment, again, we're coming off of a very strong 2022. And so, console demand has been actually quite strong. And given where we are in the cycle, we would expect gaming to be down on a year-over-year basis. But overall, I think lots of puts and takes, but we're positive on what we can do in terms of the data center and the embedded segments, given our product portfolio. And we'll watch the macro on the client and gaming and see how that plays out.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to ask a question about gross margin. The margin, I guess, sequentially down a little bit into March. But I kind of wanted to focus on the drivers of the longer-term margin that's down, I guess, three or four points from where you were a few quarters ago despite more mix of the revenue coming from embedded and data center. So if there's any way that you guys could try to quantify maybe how much of the margin headwind is from just lower client revenue? How much of it might be from any programs that you're working through to clear the channel? And how might we model? What are the drivers that we should think about in terms of the margin recovering?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Maybe -- so on the overall margin, the way to think about our business, Matt, is -- and our margin is primarily driven by product mix. So as the embedded and data center businesses are -- grow, so the margin expansion grows with it. In terms of the sequential question that you had from Q4 to Q1, that's just a product of the mix. So with data center being lower sequentially, that's that. We are also working through our client inventory clearing. What we're seeing in the PC business is, as we're going through this sort of normalization of inventory, especially on some of the older products, we do have more marketing programs and pricing incentives in place. We do expect that to normalize as we go through the first half of the year. And so, as Jean said in the prepared remarks, we would expect margin expansion as we go into the second half with the growth in data center, embedded and some normalization of the client business as well. Operator Thank you. Your next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities. Your line is now live.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,5,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question. Thanks and best wishes to Devinder and Jean from my side as well. On the first one, Lisa, I think you mentioned some elevated inventory among your cloud customers. I was hoping you could give us some quantification of how elevated? Is it a one-quarter issue? Is it a two-quarter issue? Does it impact the pace of your Genoa ramp? Because I think coming into this year, the expectations where you could grow server sales by over 20%. Do you think that is still a possibility because I imagine you get some benefit from better general pricing. So just puts and takes of how we should think about your data center business through this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,6,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure, Vivek. So look, we remain very bullish about our data center business. I mean, I think the feedback that we've gotten on Genoa from our customer set is very strong. And as I said, the important thing is we are expanding workloads. In terms of where we believe the -- as the inventory normalizes, each customer is different, so they have what they're trying to achieve in terms of inventory levels. Our expectation is that sort of the first half softness for cloud and then second half strength as that's worked through. But like I said, it's different for each customer. And then, in terms of overall growth, as I said, we're very bullish on the overall growth of our data center business and the opportunity to gain share as we go through the year. And as we go through the ramp in Genoa, we do have more content with the higher core count that should also help ASPs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,7,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. And then, on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is -- could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year on year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So maybe just to make sure that we're just correlating the numbers. So my comment about PC TAM being down 10% was assuming, if you take a look at sort of what IDC just published for -- in 2022 at about 290 million units, and that's more of a sell-through TAM versus a sell-in TAM. So we have been under-shipping sort of the sell-through or consumption for the last two quarters in an attempt to renormalize that as soon as possible. In terms of do I think it's conserve -- I think it's in the ZIP code. I think it's in the ZIP code. So if you imagine 2023 sell-through TAM of about 260 million units, plus or minus, seems to be about the right number. We have made good progress in inventory normalization. We want to be cautious, obviously, heading into the year just given the macro environment. First quarter, we said would be roughly seasonal for PCs. I think second quarter -- first quarter should be the bottom for us in PCs. We -- and then grow from there into the second quarter and then into the second half. And I should note also, Vivek, I mean, we just launched our Ryzen 7000 series with sort of our AI capabilities, both from a notebook and desktop standpoint. So we feel good about the product road map in PCs. Obviously, we have to get through this normalization. Most of the focus is on continuing to differentiate our products and working with our customers to offer sort of very strong platforms. Operator Thank you. Next question is coming from Stacy Rasgon from Bernstein Research.

Thanks for taking my questions. I noted that you said that gross margins would expand in the second half, but you didn't give us any color on how much they might expand. Can you give us any idea like first half to second half?

Thanks for taking my questions. Stacy, this is Jean. Let me take this question, then Lisa can add. As we talk about it, it's both our embedded and data center segment have strong gross margins. So we feel pretty good about second half. We continue to have the growth of both embedded and data center segment. The major headwind we are facing is really client side, which if you think about the gross margin in the first half of 2022 versus the first half of 2023, the major impact is from the client revenue, inventory correction, which impact the gross margin in the client segment. So going into second half, the normalization of the client segment will help us to expand the gross margin. I think it really depends on how the client segment will recover. That will drive the gross margin if it's going to go back to the first half of 2022 or expand beyond that level. But overall, we feel pretty good. Once we normalize the client segment, our gross margin will continue to expand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

I think it depends a bit on what happens in the macro environment. But we do feel good about second half expansion, and we'll see sort of the relative recovery in macro as it relates to all of our segments.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,13,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. I guess for my follow-up, maybe it follows up on that a little bit more just around the mix. I get how data center and embedded should be growing in the second half versus the first half. But presumably, client will, too, first half to second half, given that you are undershipping, it sounds like by a pretty wide margin right now. How do you feel about your mix just across the four businesses of the second half versus the first half? Do you think your data center plus embedded mix, as a percentage of total revenue in the second half, is materially higher than it is in the first half? Or I mean, could it even be not that different at all given the potential growth that you might see just from the channel normalization in clients?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I think the way to think about it is, I think our data center grow -- growth in the second half versus first half, we expect that to be significantly stronger. As it relates to clients, we would also expect it to be stronger. Again, depending a bit on macro and sort of how the TAM actually evolves. I think for the embedded businesses, I would say that we expect to grow over the full year 2023 versus 2022. What we see right now is a fairly strong backlog and good visibility into the first half of the year. I'm not ready to say that embedded will grow in the second half versus the first half, though, because we're coming off very strong growth already. And so, I think those are the puts and takes.

Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, the pushback that we often get is AMD is doing really well, gaining share, but you're gaining share in relatively mature markets. And when it comes to AI, you do have a strategy, but you really haven't shown the product set, if you will. You talked about how you have CPU, GPU, FPGA and Pensando, and you're shipping samples of MI300, I guess, later this quarter and potentially launching in the second half. At what point do we, as analysts and investors, start to see your AI strategy materialize in the P&L and your profitability, if you will.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. We believe that AI is a huge driver of compute growth. And given our portfolio, it should be a driver of our growth as well. I think if you think about the product sets that we are putting sort of AI content in, you should expect MI300, of course, on the GPU training side. We just launched Ryzen AI in our PC portfolio. You can expect additional AI acceleration coming in our server portfolio as well. So you're going to see AI broadly across our road maps. In terms of when -- we've talked before about sort of our data center GPU ambitions and the opportunity there. We see it as a large opportunity. As we go into the second half of the year and launch MI300, sort of the first user of MI300 will be the supercomputers or El Capitan, but we're working closely with some large cloud vendors as well to qualify MI300 in AI workloads. And we should expect that to be more of a meaningful contributor in 2024.

And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps -- you were over-earning in that business given the environment?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,18,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure. So I think on the client segment, it's fair to say that we believe, given where we are with the client inventory levels, the first half will certainly be lower. We expect some improvement in the second half. But in terms of overall margin, we expect that the client business will be below the corporate average, and that's how we're modeling the client business. Operator Thank you.

So Aaron, we started shipping Genoa in the third quarter that ramped into the fourth quarter and will continue to ramp through 2024. The way I think about -- or the way you should think about the Genoa ramp is that it is a new platform for our customers. So they'll be introducing it -- introducing first-in-cloud sort of internal workloads and then going to external workloads and then enterprise. So I think it will be throughout 2024. We have -- I'm sorry, throughout 2023. We do have higher core counts on Genoa. So you would expect that that will give us some ASP uplift as we go through to some of those higher core count products. Bergamo will launch in the first half of the year. We are on track for the Bergamo launch, and you'll see that become a larger contributor in the second half. So as we think about the Zen 4 ramp and the crossover to our Zen 3 ramp, it should be toward the end of the year, sort of in the fourth quarter, that you would see a crossover of sort of Zen 4 versus Zen 3, if that helps you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then, as a quick follow-up, the business doesn't really ask that much about, but it's been doing phenomenally well here these last couple of quarters. It's actually the Xilinx business. I know it's within the embedded largely. But your self reporting, I think if I read the filings correctly, growing 40% plus on a like-for-like basis for Xilinx. I think your competitor also growing a solid pace. How do you think about the sustainability or durability of that demand in that embedded or Xilinx business as we move through '23?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Aaron, that business has done very well. So the Xilinx business, I think our overall embedded business continues to do well. When we look across the subsegments, there are puts and takes in the subsegments. But what we see is content is going up. So we had records in communications, industrial and healthcare, aerospace and defense, automotive. We have the embedded processor content that's also going into automotive. So we feel very good about that business. I think as we look into 2023, I mentioned this in the question with Stacy. We have a very good visibility to the first half just given the lead times and the backlog. And the first half looks strong, so we expect to grow sequentially in the first quarter. As we go into the second half of the year, we're monitoring the overall demand environment. And just given how strong it's been, we are looking at whether there'll be some puts and takes in some of the end market segments there. But overall, I think the key point is the content, and our design win momentum is good, and we continue to ramp new design wins in the Xilinx business. Operator Thank you.

I wonder if you could talk to us about the puts and takes of PC market share in a down 10% environment. I would assume it helps you with consumers better than commercial, but what is your progress in terms of penetrating the notebook market and penetrating the commercial market where you could continue to gain share?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,24,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Joe, we view that the opportunity -- so first of all, I would say that in general, the PC market share numbers are probably a bit noisy right now, just given all of the sell-in, sell-through and the inventory dynamics that are being worked through. Actually, in the fourth quarter, we believe we gained a little bit of share in the PC market. As we go forward into 2023, we think our product portfolio is very strong. As we look at Ryzen 7000 and where it goes and where we are positioned in the commercial, as well as the high-end consumer segments, we're not changing our strategy on PCs. Quite -- a few years ago, we really focused on sort of the more premium segments. We have less penetration in the low end, which I think is helpful. And as we go forward, we're continuing to focus on commercial PCs and getting a larger footprint in there. I will say the enterprise work that we're doing on the server side, I think, links very well to the commercial PC work, and we're continuing to invest in sort of the sales and marketing resources to ramp that side of the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then, going back to the Genoa question that was asked a second ago, as you are in this kind of budget conscious environment, you're introducing a chip in a system that has pretty high platform cost. Does that slow the adoption at all? It seems like people -- and your competitors dealing with some of the same issues. Just how does the current environment affect the rate at which Genoa will ramp?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,26,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I would say, Joe, the total cost of ownership benefit of Genoa, particularly in some of the larger cloud workloads, is very, very significant. So I wouldn't say that that's necessarily slowing the pace of adoption. It is a new platform though. So if you think about when we went from Rome to Milan, it was basically similar platforms. So I would say that that ramp was a bit faster. But as it relates to Genoa, we had always expected that Milan and Genoa would coexist through 2023. And that we would have -- we still have Milan instances that are just ramping now, and we expect that will continue through 2023. And so, I really view this as the natural thing when we introduce Genoa at sort of the higher core count, that both will coexist. And as some of the platform costs come down, you'll see the Genoa cutover, and that's what I mentioned toward the fourth quarter of 2023. Operator Thank you.

Let me ask a question. And Jean, congrats on the new job. Lisa, I was hoping you could give a little bit of sequential color to just size the magnitude of the three segments that are going down in the first quarter and then embedded going up. And really what I'm getting at there is, in an answer to a prior question, you talked about the mix being a headwind to gross margin. And I think, Jean, you cited data center dropping as a percent of the mix. So just trying to get the magnitude of just how much data center has to drop to make that outcome on the mix side be true.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

So let's see. We said the client and gaming segments would be seasonal. So you would expect that the data center would be more than seasonal. So maybe to help you size that, think about the data center sequential drop as double digit, whereas the client and the gaming segments are more like single digit, if that helps.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,31,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. Sorry for the nitpicky question. A bigger picture one for you then, Lisa, on competitive intensity. On one hand, I could see that the total cost of ownership benefits of these products, multicore, better performance, etc., could lead to higher ASPs, whether you're talking about the data center side or your client business. On the other side, competitive intensity and overall demand is weaker. And at some point, you might even get deflationary costs on the foundry side of things. Can you talk a little bit about the pricing environment given those somewhat contradictory pressures?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So maybe let me separate data center and client because they're a little bit different. I think on the data center side, we would -- we do see that, in general, the performance, the power performance, the total cost of ownership, selling the solution is the most important piece of it because the solutions are actually quite different in terms of what you can do between sort of fourth gen EPYC and sort of other solutions. The environment is always competitive, but we feel very good about the overall value proposition that we bring to both cloud and enterprise customers. I think on the Client side, we've said for the last couple of quarters that the pricing environment is more aggressive. I think that normally happens when the industry is working on rebalancing. I think we're working on rebalancing, our OEM partners are working on rebalancing. The retailers are working on rebalancing. And so, there are more incentives and more -- a more aggressive pricing environment. I view that that's primarily on, let's call it, older products, let's call it previous generation products. And as we work through that, there will be some normalization as we think about our newer generation products where there's more capability added. So hopefully, that gives you a little bit of the puts and takes. And in terms of the cost environment, I think all of us in the industry have seen some elevated costs, but I think we also see -- expect that to normalize too as everyone is sort of optimizing their capex spending.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my question and congrats to Jean on the new seat. Two questions, if I may. First, on the PC side. Can you give us a sense about roughly how far under consumption, you believe, you're shipping on the PC side, either in Q4 and Q1? And Lisa, correct me if I am wrong, I thought I heard you say in an answer to an earlier question that you expect the PC client but just to grow into second quarter. So does that suggest that 1Q, you think is the bottom on the PC? And then, I had a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,35,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Mark. So we -- so the first -- the second question, yes. We do believe the first quarter is the bottom for our PC market -- for our PC business, and we'll see some growth in the second quarter and then a seasonally higher second half. In terms of the under shipment, I mean, I think we're -- we undershipped in Q3, we undershipped in Q4. We will undership, to a lesser extent, in Q1. So I think you can infer that from our guidance single-digit down. And then, we'll be back to a more normal environment. Now, just as a reminder though, the first half is not usually a -- the first half is usually a seasonally weak client time anyways. So we would expect more lift in the second half, not so much in the second quarter.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

That's very helpful. And then, a follow-up, if I may, on the -- China is lifting, as they're lifting the COVID restrictions, I guess I would imagine that you would expect that ultimately, at some point, to translate into higher demand. And I'm wondering if you could just kind of share with us your thoughts about how that might play out?

So we've done a very good job in our supply chain in terms of risk mitigation. So we have -- we don't believe that we have a significant risk as it relates to COVID future outbreaks, if there are any. As it relates to China recovery, I think we would benefit from a China recovery. It's very difficult to call. I mean, we've seen, certainly in our data center business, we saw in the second half of the year and last year in the first half of this year that the China data center business has been weak for us. If there was a recovery, I think we would benefit from that. Similarly, some of the other consumer patterns as well. But it's very difficult to call. So we put that in the bucket of macro uncertainty, and we'll see how it plays out.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2022-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 1, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,42,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I guess, Chris, what I would say is I think the PC market has been volatile, and we did significantly -- coming off the pandemic, there was very high demand during the pandemic, and I think we were all adjusting as we're looking at sort of the demand environment post pandemic and with macro uncertainty. I think the data center business, we have again, our -- we're heavily weighted toward cloud, and we have very good discussions with our overall customer set in terms of what they need. I think what's going in our favor in the data center is our workloads are expanding. And so, we've heard from all of our cloud customers that they're adopting both Milan and Genoa in more workloads than previous. And so, I think that gives us good confidence. And frankly, the data center customers are also giving us good visibility into what they need for 2023. So there is an adjustment in the first half. And I think that's something that we understand. And we also expect that we're going to have to ramp up production in the second half as some of the demand resumes. And I think the overall factor of compute in the cloud being a very important long-term driver is definitely there. So we feel good about sort of where we're positioned. Operator Thank you.

So let me make a couple of points. I think all of us, as we participate in the PC industry, there are various parts of the ecosystem that we work with. We work with our OEMs, we work with our retail partners, we work with our distribution and channel partners. And we're all working together to work through sort of the elevated inventory levels. As I said, I think we've made good progress on that. And I think we have much better visibility into the various pieces. As it relates to the pricing environment, I do believe that the pricing environment is -- particularly when you're clearing older inventory or older generation products, is a bit more competitive. And we see that. As we look forward, the way we're modeling the client business is that we are modeling gross margins to be less than corporate average. That's different than our previous modeling. So previously, client was more like at corporate average. And I think given the -- I think the nice thing is our business is quite a bit more diversified now. And so, with our data center, embedded businesses really being strong growth drivers, I think client continues to be a good market overall.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, it is a little bit early to talk about 2023 precisely, but maybe let me give you a backdrop of where we see the data center market today. As you said, in the near term, there are some overall macro headwinds that are affecting all markets, including the data center market. Now it varies by segment. And so, if I go through each of the segments, what we're seeing is I think North America cloud is probably the most resilient out of the segments within the data center market, and this is where AMD is the strongest. We've had very good progress at the North America cloud vendors. And we continue to believe that although there may be some near-term, let's call it, optimization of, let's call it, individual footprints, and efficiencies at individual cloud vendors over the medium term, as we go into 2023, we expect growth in that market, particularly customers moving more workloads to AMD, just given the strength of our product portfolio and overall -- Genoa coming forward. As we look through the other segments, I think China is -- has been very weak in 2022, and we're not forecasting a significant recovery in 2023. So, we'll see how that goes. And then on the enterprise side, I would say enterprise is probably most impacted by the macro. So, we have seen customers taking longer to make decisions and perhaps being a little bit more conservative on capex. That being said, though, we feel very good about our value proposition. We feel very good about our product portfolio. And we believe, even in a little bit of a choppy market that we can gain share across that business. So, overall, I think our Data Center trends are good, and we need to work through the macro, as everyone does.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margins, maybe for Devinder. So, you're guiding Q4 gross margins up about 100 basis points, which is good to see, but you're still 300 basis points below where you were in Q2. And since then, obviously, Client is down significantly. Your Data Center business is very resilient and so is the classic Xilinx business. So, from a mix perspective, you should be in a better place. What's driving down gross margins in Q4, I guess, versus Q2? Are you recognizing another inventory hit? Or is it something else? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

On the gross margin, as you said, Q2, 54%. If you go all the way to Q4, 51% primarily is the weak PC market and Client margins coming down. For example, if you look at Q3, all other businesses were in line with expectations, and Client margins came in lower. We also have in the Data Center, a place cloud-weighted, which has lower ASPs. So, that also has an impact on margins. And then as Lisa mentioned earlier, some of the new capacity that we have from a supply standpoint, there are some additional costs from the supply capacity agreements. And those are all baked in into the Q4 51% margin guidance.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Stacy, we're not really counting on a material impact from the extra week. I think if you look at the pluses and minuses in the quarter, the guidance for Q4 really is around sort of PCs and, let's call it, Gaming being lower. And again, those are -- with all the holidays in place, we're not counting on too much there.

For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about units versus pricing in Q3 and Q4. I know in Q3, you specifically mentioned pricing has an impact. And it sounds like you're suggesting Client margins are coming down. I don't know if that's just a cost or if there's a pricing impact as well. But like what did units and pricing do in Client in Q3? And what are you expecting in Q4?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,15,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Stacy. So, I think if you look at the third quarter, it was -- there are a lot of dynamics in the Client business. So, market was weak. In particular, consumer was weak. And we have more of a footprint in consumer. So, in that framework, we saw units come down. But we also saw ASPs come down on a sequential basis. Now, I will say that ASPs were still up on a year-over-year basis. So, we've been, let's call it, disciplined in this pricing environment. We did see some pricing dynamics in the quarter, and we couldn't face unprofitable business. And we'll continue to be sort of watching that space. So, that was the pluses or minuses as it relates to Client ASPs. And as we go into the fourth quarter, again, I think we're forecasting for a competitive environment given the market weakness, and that's embedded in the guide.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

For the first one, I just wanted to clarify what is the client revenue we should be thinking about for Q4? Is it $800 million, $900 million? Any help there? And then, I guess, Lisa, the bigger question there is, what does client recovery look like? Do you get back to the $2 billion quarterly rate? Do you get to $1.5 billion? And I asked that because your competitor was suggesting that next year, the PC TAM would only be down 4% or 5%, which seems a little bit optimistic. What do you think AMD is kind of -- what kind of PC TAM does AMD have in mind for next year so that we get a sense for how this derisk the model is from a PC perspective?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,18,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, a couple of different points, Vivek. Let me just answer the sort of the expectations around Q4. I would say we're guiding, let's call it, modestly down for Client and Gaming. And obviously, we're coming off of what is already a low base in Q3. We want to do that to correct the sort of the inventory situation as quickly as possible. And as a result, we're going to under-ship consumption again in the fourth quarter to do that. As it relates to next year, I think there are a lot of factors. I mean, this year, PCs will be down quite a bit, let's call it, high teens, close to 20%. As we go into next year, I think the industry is calling mid-single digits. I think that would be a good case. I think we should model down to minus 10%. And again, within our PC business, we expect as we get through this inventory correction -- I mean, we have very good products, and I feel very good about our product portfolio and very good about our platforms overall. So, I do think the PC business will recover as we go into 2023, but we'll have to work through these dynamics over the next quarter or so.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, Devinder, maybe one for you on gross margins. How much of the write-offs and pricing actions that you're taking in -- that you took in Q3 and are taking in Q4? How much are they recoverable in Q1? So, let's say, hypothetically, Q1 revenue is the same as Q4 revenue. What can gross margins be? How much of the actions are recoverable? And basically, how do you start getting back to the prior trend of 54% gross margin because the longer-term target is over 57%? So, if Client revenues don't really grow that much, are there actions that can help you get back to your prior gross margin trajectory?

If you look at Q3 in and of itself, we came in with about 50% gross margin. We had $160 million of charges, which are inventory pricing and related charges. If you adjust for those, the margin for -- in Q3 is about 52%. And we had guided to 54%. We came in at 52%. And primarily, that's due to two reasons, right? You have the Client weak PC market. And obviously, the Client margins are down. As I said earlier, the rest of the business will perform for the expectations. We have to work through what's going on with the PC market over this quarter, next quarter, and maybe early '23, and then we come back and talk about the margins. I do feel good about the products we're introducing, especially the new products and perhaps the ability to increase margins from where we are right now, guiding 51% and then taking it up from there.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,26,Matthew Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good afternoon, Lisa. At least I have one question on the Data Center segment and then a follow-up on Client. On the Data Center business, if you look back to the pre-announcement a month ago, I think there was a little bit of maybe -- you came in a little bit under where we were modeling, I'll just say that way. And so, I got a ton of questions on that, and I was really interested in some of the comments that you made in your script about how cloud revenue still more than doubled year over year. And anyway, just confirming that I got that right. And maybe if you could help us break down your Data Center business a little bit between the strength in cloud that I would expect to continue given the capex commentary we've heard, but there were obviously some headwinds from enterprise that you called out and clearly from HPC, both on CPU and GPU. So, I think that would be helpful to just break it down because I was surprised that that cloud revenue was as strong as it was given where the numbers came in in the quarter. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,27,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Matt. So, for focus on the third quarter, what I would say is cloud revenue did more than double. Enterprise revenue was down. And then on the GPU side, because we had a strong quarter in the third quarter of 2021, that was down, too. And perhaps that wasn't quite in your modeling. But the larger dynamics are, as I said earlier, the North America cloud is probably the best out of all the Data Center segments. There is some impact on macro, though. I mean, I think everyone is aware of that, that there is a little bit of pullback in capex spending. That being the case, I think our market share is very good there, and we'll -- we expect it to continue to grow. And as the business becomes more cloud weighted -- there have been a few margin questions, so I'll just mention, as the business becomes more cloud weighted, that tends to have a little bit of downward pressure on the margin. But our goal right now is footprint and expanding our footprint across cloud and enterprise. I will say even in a weak enterprise market as we go forward over the next few quarters, we feel really good about how we're positioned and the platform solutions that are coming out with all of our OEM partners. So, I think on a quarter-by-quarter basis, you may not get the model exactly right. But I think on a longer-term basis, I think the product portfolio and the product capabilities should help us continue to gain share.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

That's helpful, I think, to highlight the cloud momentum continuing. I guess as my follow-up, I wanted to kind of revisit what we've learned over the last three or four months in the PC market. It's super dynamic times out there. And obviously, things have changed in demand really, really quickly from when you guys guided back at the beginning of August until the pre-announcement. And I just kind of wanted to walk back through sort of the dynamics of how the quarter progressed from when you guys gave the original guidance. I guess, obviously, the market went down. There was inventory corrections and whatnot. But just how quickly did you guys see that? And I guess the real question coming out of this is, how are you thinking about changes you might make in monitoring inventory levels or working with your channel partners? Just any changes you're thinking about making operationally to the business to sort of protect from this kind of thing coming and, I guess, going forward?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Matt. So, yes, the third quarter, the PC market was very volatile. Going into it, we expected the market would be weak. It was weaker than we expected. And the weakest portion of the market is a consumer market where we tend to be more heavily weighted. I think the thing that perhaps we saw in the market is we -- as the overall macro economy has also weakened, customers, in general, across the board, have just become more cautious. So, even as they were selling through their inventory, they were not replenishing stock to the same levels. And frankly, we were coming off of a supply demand imbalance where in the first half of the year, people were actually trying to gather inventory, and we had been in a supply constrained situation. So, it is a very dynamic situation, I would say. I think that we have great partnerships across the supply chain. I feel good about the visibility that we have. I think the market will continue to be volatile, but we will -- we're all sort of biased toward reducing inventory levels so that we can better react to the market factors and the market situation. So, hopefully, that helps a little bit.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Absolutely, Joe. So, the Xilinx business, our Embedded business has been performing just extremely well. Another very strong quarter in Q3, and we have -- we see growth into the fourth quarter. We have been very focused on what's happening within the various subsegments. I think the nice part of the business, as you know, is that it has -- it's very broad-based. So, we have seen communications was up for us. Aerospace and defense, very strong. Automotive was also up for us here in the third quarter. We did see some weaknesses. Consumer was weak. There was some subsegments of industrial. So, test and measurement was weaker in the third quarter. So, we do see the puts and takes there. But overall, I would say the business has strong visibility. We are still supply constrained in certain nodes and some of the legacy nodes. We've made a lot of progress on supply. So, we're seeing additional supply come in, in Q4, and that leads us to good confidence in Q4. We expect the first half -- again, we have multiple quarters of visibility just given the lead times in that business, and we'll be watching it very carefully.

Sure, Ross. Well, since -- on an absolute level, we're talking about flattish from Q4 to Q3, 5.5 versus 5.6. So, modest decline in Client and Gaming. Within Gaming, we would expect consoles to be down in the fourth quarter given they're coming off of Q3, which is their peak. That's offset a bit by our new graphics launch that is occurring in the next few weeks. And then as it relates to Data Center and Embedded, it's about the same, let's call it, modest plus as we go forward. We expect, again, cloud to be stronger than enterprise. That's some of the margin dynamics that we were asking earlier. And Embedded, as we get more supply, you know, modestly up as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

I think the key thing is we continue to invest in the strategic areas, in Data Center and Embedded, and the product road maps. The macro environment has weakened, soft PCs. And we are taking actions to reduce expenses, especially in the rest of the business besides what I talked about earlier in terms of the areas of focus, and we have slowed down hiring. So, you're right, Q4, if you look at E2R business is high, but we are very disciplined in terms of what we're going to do. Expense actions do take time to kick in. And we expect that as we go out into 2023, the E2R comes more in balance with the revenue, and we manage it in line with the revenue out in time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to come back to the PC business. There's such a big disparity between your 3Q guide and what Intel guided to or reported versus what they're guiding to in 4Q. And usually, things normalize over a longer period of time. But I just wanted to understand, is it a case of they took their medicine earlier and AMD continued to over-ship versus demand? Just kind of help us understand. And there seems to be also a dynamic that Intel is raising pricing in 4Q. So, there was some pull-in ahead of that. And I have -- I've been getting a lot of questions myself. I don't understand specific disparity. So, any help would be very helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Ambrish. Look, I think -- again, let me comment on our business, right? So, for our business, as we exited the first half of the year, I think we were planning for a sort of a reasonable PC market in the second half. Usually, the third quarter is higher than the first half. And the third and the fourth quarter are seasonally higher. And so, that's what we were building to, together with our customers, by the way, with that expectation. I think the market weakness, as well as just the overall caution in the environment just caused people to behave a bit differently, and that really required us to work together with our customers on the inventory corrections. And as you said, there were some temporal sort of dynamics. And we're aware of those temporal dynamics. Some of it is very -- sort of very aggressive pricing that we chose not to follow. And again, that's a decision that we made. And others are, as you might expect, there might be some temporal optimization that people are doing. I don't think there's anything fundamental. I think fundamentally, our product portfolio is strong. I think we have very good platforms in place, and we'll work through this. I fully agree that it's kind of a messy market environment that we have to work through, but we will work through it.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

I mean, the capacity agreement that we were working on, which have some benefit, especially as Lisa talked about earlier in the service space, these are long-term agreements we put in place to support the growth of the business. Given the market backdrop, we work actively with our suppliers in aligning supply with timing of revenue and ramp up products. And that's something that we are able to do with our suppliers given what's happened to the market. So, there is, from that standpoint, some flexibility overall.

Thanks for taking my question. In Data Center, the team continues to expand the number of compute instances with your cloud customers on Milan. It seems like the momentum is carrying up through the ramp of your fourth-generation Genoa platforms. I think this is a very good dynamic. I assume you guys have good visibility here. So, how long does the Milan momentum continue into next year? And are your cloud customers already qualifying Genoa? And when do you expect Genoa to start to kick into high-volume ramp?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,45,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question, Harlan. So, yes, look, we're very happy with our Milan sort of workload ramp. We are continuing to ramp Milan here this year and then into next year as well. As it relates to Genoa, we did start initial shipments of Genoa to our strategic customers in the third quarter. That is continuing in the fourth quarter. So, we're ramping production in the fourth quarter. A lot of the, let's call it, the qualifications or the first instances are being qualified here in the fourth quarter into the first quarter. And what we've said before is that Milan and Genoa are going to actually coexist for quite some time just given how competitive both are. Genoa is a new platform. It is new DDR5 and PCIe 5.0, and that takes a bit longer for people to qualify. And so, we would expect both to continue to ramp in 2023, and that's how we're planning the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thank you. And, you know, despite the macro concerns and, as you mentioned, some near-term workload optimization, your North American cloud customers, I mean, they're still growing their cloud services business at a strong 30%, 40% year-over-year growth rate. And I assume that these types of growth rates like the consumption of compute networking, storage workloads, and therefore, installed utilization, like this is all quite strong in driving the need to build out more compute capacity. Is this what's driving the team's sort of strong midterm outlook for this segment? Or is it more a function of your strong product lineup with Genoa and continuing to capture greater compute share or both?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Right, Harlan. I would say it's a little bit of both. And I think you said it well. In the very near term, there is a little bit of optimization that each cloud vendor is doing. But in the medium term, what our customers are telling us is they need more compute. And the more compute is for additional workloads, you know, building out. It's also for upgrade of, let's call it, older compute given our new products have very strong TCO, power efficiency, given the cost of power and energy around the world. We're actually seeing that also be a driver for some of the conversion to AMD in the cloud as we go into 2023.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

I got it. OK. Yeah. I want to be responsive to the question. Well, let's start with the Data Center. I think in the Data Center, we believe that we will continue to gain share. We expect to continue to gain share in both cloud and enterprise. We are more underrepresented in enterprise. And so, again, that's a key focus for us. But as we just stated in the last few questions, I think North America cloud, in particular, I think we see line of sight to significant new deployments based on our current road map. In the desktop and notebook business, our focus is on certain segments. So, we're very focused on premium. We're very focused on gaming. And we're focused on commercial. I think in those areas, there are, again, opportunities for us to continue to gain share. I think in desktop DIY business or sort of the desktop channel business, we have a strong lineup. We just launched the new Ryzen 7000 Series. We have additional products that we'll launch next year as well. And that's sort of the puts and takes in the various businesses.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, I guess, just getting back into the macros that you mentioned that ASPs are getting a little -- or at least pricing is getting a little tough on CPUs. If this downturn in PCs continues into next year and if it spreads into the data center market, how do you think of pricing going forward? And would you choose to maybe give up some share if your competitor remains aggressive on price and the environment stays difficult?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Our strategy is not to lead on price. So, if you look at -- look in the Data Center, although price is one factor, we find price is not the leading factor in the majority of the selections. There is work for us to do in terms of workload optimization, and that's where a lot of our focus has been in the Data Center. So, hopefully, that answers that piece. As it relates to the PC business, it is more price-sensitive. We have seen it become more price-sensitive. I think, again, where we have a strong value proposition, we will continue to be very competitive. But even back a year ago, we didn't choose to compete in the Chrome market because, again, that was just not a profitable business for us.

So, I'm wondering if maybe you can help us with what China is on a consumption basis and kind of how you handicap where your China TAM is going.

Sure, Tim. So, we are certainly watching the situation very closely. Upon reviewing all of the new regulations as they have gone into effect, it is minimal impact on our revenue in the near term. We're certainly working very closely with commerce and the rest of the U.S. government on how those are rolling out. And then I think on a medium-term basis, again, my view on these things is we will always follow the U.S. regulations and understand the need for national security. The majority of our China business is, let's call it, non-data center. So, it's more in the PC business, as well as in some of the consumer-facing businesses. So, we are paying attention to that as we go forward in the business.

And then I guess I wanted to ask a question about PCs. So, you guided in late July, and it seemed like things were fine. And then we lost basically $1 billion basically in two months. It would seem like those were massively weak months, and I would think that maybe there's been some improvement in the run rate when you kind of head into Q4. Does that mean inventory has sort of leaned out a little bit? I mean, the market probably only absorbed, I don't know, 58 million units in Q3. And if you annualize that, you're at 200 million units a year. It's like hard to get PCs that bad next year. So, I'm just kind of wondering if you can comment on sort of the run rate because August and September must have been terrible months.

I would say that we did drain a good amount of inventory in the third quarter. I think we are -- our guide indicates a desire to drain more in the fourth quarter, and I think we will make progress in that. And of course, it all depends on how the macro behaves over the next couple of months.

I want to go back to just the pricing question prior. If you look at the decline in your Client business, a little over 50%, is there a way to think about units versus pricing there? And I think there's a couple of factors. I'd be curious your thoughts mix away from the high end, but then you mentioned competition, just kind of your thoughts as to that impact to pricing as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,65,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, Blayne, it was certainly more units. I think Stacy asked the question earlier. ASPs were down sequentially, but they were up year over year. So, the decline was more driven by units, but there was an ASP factor on a sequential basis. And then in terms of what we see in the market, I would say that as the market weakened, there was sort of more pressure at the high end in terms of just velocity and desire to clear inventory. And so, the mix did mix toward lower ASPs and toward more incentives to clear that inventory. As it relates to longer term, though, I don't feel like there's a longer-term significant mix change, if that's what you were asking.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

Mix is kind of going in your favor with Data Center and Embedded. But then I guess you're saying PCs are not down that much, so I can't -- I guess I was figuring maybe pricing is not that bad either. So, I guess that's a long way of asking, again, what's the reason for the core margins to be down 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

So, let me try that. So, if you think about what we see in the business, there's a couple of factors. So, if you say, excluding the charges that we described, the $160 million in Q3, we were about 52%. We're guiding to 51%. We do see the client market continuing to be weak. We want to make sure that we have -- we do clear additional inventories. We do see in Data Center a mix to -- when the mix is higher for North America cloud, that tends to be lower ASPs just given the environment in that business. And then Devinder mentioned that as we increase capacity, particularly in the server market, there were some -- we have some additional capacity coming online, and that has a bit of cost impact.

First of all, thanks for squeezing me in. Lisa, I had a question of the near-term to, call it, midterm view of the data center market. Do you think that the data center market is inherently growing in the December quarter, the market, not AMD? And do you think -- and/or do you think you're growing because you're launching Genoa? And to that point, you talked about dislocations and sort of the cloud and the data center market. I was curious what specifically are you seeing? And if you could differentiate between -- are you seeing just slower growth, or is there inventory that's built up? And then I've got a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 1, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,71,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, look, what I would say is, again, on a very discrete basis, I wouldn't say the overall data center market is necessarily up. Just given the macro impact, there is some impact on overall spending. In terms of our business, we do have a weighting toward North America cloud that tends to be sort of the most resilient part of the market. And then as it relates to what's happening in the market, like I said, I think what's happening is -- enterprise is weak. I think that is overall people -- businesses are just being more cautious. China is weak and has been weak all year. And then in cloud, in general, there's not in general. Every customer is a bit different in what they're trying to do. Some are just optimizing inventory, some are optimizing footprint, and then some are continuing to build. And so, I wouldn't call it a market per se. I would call it their individual instances for each customer. What's helpful for us is -- what we're talking about is not just Q4 with our customers. We're really talking about what do they need for all of 2023. I mean, we are coming from a place where we were supply constrained. And so, we're planning for the capacity that's necessary. And there, we see which workloads are moving and when are they moving each of the workloads. And so, that gives us some visibility into what their spending plans are for 2023.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/01/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then for my last follow-up, can you talk about the gaming market in general? Of course, September, you mentioned was the peak quarter. So, December will be off some. But is this also the peak Gaming year in 2022? And should we be thinking that Gaming will be down?

So, Harsh, we do believe that there is still some pent-up demand, especially coming into this holiday season. So, Q3 was the peak for us this year. Q4 is down seasonally, as you might expect. Going into next year, I think there are puts and takes. I would say the best way to model at this point is to model Gaming segment flattish.

I had two questions. The first one, I wanted to better understand what's contemplated in your guidance, your Q3 guidance, as well as your implied Q4 guidance, both in terms of revenue and gross margins. If you can kind of speak to the pluses and minus on a sequential basis, that would be super helpful. And then I have a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,2,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Thanks, Toshiya, for the question. So in terms of the Q3 and the Q4 guidance, so if we would start first with Q3, I think the Q3 guidance implies that, first of all, the revenue growth is led by the data center, as well as some increase in our Semi-Custom or game console business, which historically peaks in the third quarter. We have taken a more conservative outlook on the PC business. So a quarter ago, we would have thought that the PC business would be down, let's call it, high single digits. And our current view of the PC business is that it will be down, let's call it, mid-teens. And that's contemplated into our third-quarter guidance. And then as we go into the fourth quarter, what we see is, again, the sequential growth there will be led by the data center, as well as our embedded business, with the same view of the PC business. But what we also have there is a set of new product ramps that we're very excited about. So we have a number of 5-nanometer products that will be ramping in the fourth quarter, including our client products, as well as our server -- our general products, as well as our graphics products. So that's sort of the view of Q3 and Q4 from a revenue standpoint. And then from a margin standpoint, again, we're guiding full-year margin at 54%, which is what we -- which is the same. And again, it's a mix of business in each of the businesses that is resulting in that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,3,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got It. Thank you for the color particularly around your PC assumptions. My follow-up, I was hoping you can speak to what you're seeing in your data center business. Given the macro backdrop, we get a bunch of questions from investors about the forward and sort of the concerns related to both enterprise and spending in the cloud. What are your customers telling you at this point? What kind of visibility do you have? And at what point do you become more dependent on the overall market? And I asked the question because if we take the most recent quarter, you're probably about a third of your nearest competitor in terms of revenue scale, you were about 1.7% a year ago. So obviously, you're significantly larger, curious at one point, do you become more correlated with the broader market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,4,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks for the question on the data centers. So look, the data center business has grown very nicely for us. We're pleased with the segment growth both on a year over year as well as a sequential basis. In terms of what we're seeing underneath that, in the second quarter, for example, we did see the cloud business continue to be very strong. So from what we -- from our customers, we're continuing to ramp new cloud instances and workloads with Milan and we see that continuing into the second half of the year. For the enterprise business, we actually did make also a good progress on the OEM side there as well. What I would say is the trends there are a bit more mixed and perhaps more correlated to some of the macro backdrop. So we do see a significant pipeline, although some of the deals are taking a little bit longer to close. And I would say that there are some match set of things that the OEMs are working through. But all in all, I think we continue to see significant growth opportunities as we go into the second half of the year and into 2023 just given our strong product positioning. And as I said, in this part of the cycle, we see Milan continuing to ramp into the second half of the year. And then we see Genoa coming in toward the end of the year into 2023. So I do think, to your overall question, do we become more correlated to the market? I mean, I think we are -- we've certainly gained a lot of share. So we're a larger piece of the market, but we are still underrepresented. And the visibility with our customers, especially our large cloud customers second half of this year into next year is very good. And we're planning really for the next 4 to 6 quarters, and that gives us good visibility. Operator Your next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,5,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Lisa, I just wanted to revisit the second half outlook because your large competitor recently presented a very bleak picture of PC and enterprise and data center talking about excess inventory, etc., but you are leaving your expectations relatively unchanged. I'm curious, how do you see your inventory levels? And do you think AMD could be impacted by any excess PC or server or graphics inventory from your main competitors? Just is your second half you think adequately derisked the way you see it today?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,6,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Vivek. So look, if you look at our second half guidance, and maybe let's talk about the full-year guidance. We have -- there are some puts and takes in how we're seeing the business today. So whenever we guide, we recognize that there are multiple dynamics that we're looking at. In the current guidance for the full year and the second half, what we're saying is that we continue to see strong demand in the data center, in our embedded business, as well as in the console business. And we are being more conservative in our PC outlook. Our PC outlook now at mid-teens would kind of put the market at somewhere around, let's call it, 290 million to 300 million units. So I do think we've appropriately derisked the PC business. As it relates to inventory, as we look at the current situation, given some of the COVID lockdowns and things in the second quarter. I think there was a bit of buildup in PC inventory, and we've taken that into account in the second half. We think the AMD portion of that is modest. And as a result, it will rebalance itself in the second half of the year. So overall, I think we feel very good about the second half. And again, with the portfolio that we have, one of the things that has been important is we were still supply constrained in several of the areas. Certainly, on the embedded side, we were supply constrained in the second quarter. And even on the server side, we were tight in the second quarter. We have additional supply that's coming online, especially as we get toward the end of the year. That will help us really meet more of the demand from customers. So we feel pretty good about all of those puts and takes.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,7,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. And for my follow-up, Lisa, one more on the data center side. So cloud spending seems very strong right now. But we see all these media reports about the cloud players wanting to control their spending levels, etc. When do you think that shows up in their spending outlook? Or do you think you have enough of a share gain story with Genoa coming out later this year to offset any slowdown from just a broader spending environment perspective? And just how are you feeling about the next-gen kind of Genoa versus Sapphire Rapids competitive outlook?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,8,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Vivek. So I mean, we spend a lot of time with our customers talking about what they're seeing in their businesses and what they're seeing in their markets, particularly the large cloud customers. What I would say is every customer is different. So they each have their own dynamics of what they're trying to optimize. We have seen a bit of a slowdown in China, and you might have expected that. But certainly, with North America cloud, they've been very strong this year, and the forecast are robust for next year. Relative to your overall question, I think we do feel like we're in a share gain position. I think the product positioning is such that Milan is very, very strong right now. And we think that Genoa as well is very well positioned into next year. So we'll always spend time with the customer set and see what they're seeing. But from our current view, I think we have a strong opportunity to continue to grow the data center business into 2023. And our view is we have an expanding portfolio as well. In addition to Genoa, we have our Bergamo, which is a cloud-optimized capability as well that's coming online early next year. So there's a lot of new products that are supporting sort of our growth ambitions.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,9,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- For my first question, your larger competitor now has a very sort of publicly admitted push-out on their own server product. Does that make you feel like better for what you see for your Genoa ramp, especially as we get into 2023? Is it stronger than you may have seen it previously? And I guess if that's the case, it sounds like you were still a little bit supply constrained on server in general in Q2. Do you have the supply as we go into next year to upside on that number if the orders actually do get stronger in the wake of the Sapphire Rapids delay?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,10,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Stacy. Thanks for the question. So we're very focused on our own product ramp. And certainly, the key for us was to continue to work very closely with our customers to get them to ramp as fast as possible. I think in general looks very good. We've gotten very strong feedback from the customer set. The performance looks very good. There's a lot of interest to ramp quickly on both the cloud, as well as some of the high-end enterprise stuff. So we feel very good about it. And to your question about supply, we have spent basically the last 12 months building our capacity across the world to support the type of growth that we think the product can handle. So there is a large step-up in supply that we expect to see over the next four, five quarters. And I think we'll continue to work on that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,11,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Got it. For my follow-up, I wanted to dig a little bit more into the implied Q4 outlook. Again, I know you answered some questions on some of the drivers into Q4. But if I look at it, it's taken at the dead midpoint, it's something like a 7% sequential increase from Q3 to Q4 with gross margins going up about 100 bps to 55%. I guess, of that increase, is it fair to say that the bulk of it continues to be data center and may be embedded? The gross margins to me would suggest that that's probably the case. But any more further color you could give us on the magnitude of what's driving that increase would be helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,12,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I think, Stacy, the bulk of the increase is certainly led by the data center and the embedded segments. Actually, our embedded segment has performed really well. Very pleased with the growth that we're seeing there. And then in terms of the margin, it very much is a mix within the business as well. So the pluses and minuses are, yes, data center and embedded are up, but the mix of data center is a little bit more to cloud than enterprise, and embedded a bit more from communications than some of the other markets. But overall, the 7% increase, I think, is very well supported given all of the new product ramps that we have going on in addition to some additional supply that's coming in as we get into the fourth quarter. And just as a reminder, it's also a 14-week quarter for us in Q4. And so all those things give us sort of the implied guide. Operator The next question is coming from Ross Seymore from Deutsche Bank.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

And, Laura, congratulations on your retirement. Lisa, I want to dig a little bit into the Gaming business. You obviously have the two parts of that: the client GPUs and the game console side of things. It seems like there are very different dynamics happening there. So when you talked about the -- I believe you said the client GPU side would be down year over year in the third quarter. Can you just talk a little bit about what's happening there? Is that just a reflection of the PC market? Or is there any sort of share gains, product issues going on? And then the Semi-Custom color, you sounded like it's going to remain strong for the rest of the year. So is there -- is that just the fourth year of the ramp or the third year, I guess, it would be -- or is there some sort of seasonal effect we should appreciate as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,14,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Ross. Thanks for the question. So our gaming business is the two halves of the sort of the discrete graphics or the consumer graphics and then our game console business. So I would say that on the Semi-Custom side, let's take that first. The console business has been very strong. So I would say it's a strong cycle. Overall, we were more supply constrained in sort of last year into the first half of this year. We've been able to get additional supply for that. I think there's continued belief that it's a strong cycle for the consoles. We expect consoles to peak in the third quarter, and then the normal seasonality would see a decline in the fourth quarter. As it relates to the consumer graphics, I would say that as we entered this year, we were coming off of a very strong 2021 for consumer graphics where gaming demand was very high, we have seen a slowdown here in the second quarter, and we expect that is somewhat due to sort of demand now -- sort of the supply now and more supply versus demand, as well as some of the macro issues as it relates to consumer spending. We do expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, though, that we'll see some sequential increase in that business because we'll have new products that are launching in that time frame. So those are the puts and takes. I think overall, as a segment, we continue to believe gaming is a long-term secular driver. There are some sort of short-term dynamics here in the PC market that we're dealing with. But I think the fact that the game consoles have performed so well is a positive for the segment.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,15,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- I guess, for my follow-up, switching over to the gross margin side of things. You guys have done an amazing job on that, and Xilinx obviously helps raise the bar as well. As we look forward, I know you have a long-term target of 57%, can you just talk about if supply becomes looser? And I know you have areas that are loosening and areas that are tight simultaneously. But can you talk about the cost inflation you're feeling? Do you think that will lessen at all next year? And kind of how do we think about the March from the 55 you seem to be exiting this year at to the 57. What's the sort of timetable and the drivers of that increase?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,16,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I think, Ross, what I would say is the business is certainly getting to scale across the board. So the increase in margins as we go forward in the long-term model really is as a result of mix. So what we've said is that we believe the data center and embedded businesses can get to over 50% of the company. We're right now sitting probably in the low 40s, and we expect data center, in particular, to grow faster than the rest of the company, and that will drive sort of margin We're all working on costs and trying to ensure there are some inflationary kind of costs that are out there. We're all working on trying to keep those to a minimum. And frankly, going back to the work of working on cost reductions as we do in semiconductors over time. But the primary margin expansion for us is in data center as well as embedded growing sort of faster than the other businesses.

Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the server business. Obviously, the growth is very strong right now. But a lot of that business continues to be driven by the engagements that you've had and continue to build out with cloud. As we look forward over the next, I mean you had talked in some of your script about how you guys were preparing for continued growth in the Server business over the next four, six, eight quarters. And the road map is going to diversify some next year with Bergamo and Ciena and Genoa seeming to launch on top of the Genoa platform. And I wonder if you give some color on how the relationships and engagements are going in enterprise and in the telco wireless space as well? I'm just trying to get a gauge of how quickly the server business can grow through diversification, not just continued share gains with cloud.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,18,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Matt. So definitely, I think our focus -- we love the progress that we're making in cloud, and we're going to continue to earn every amount of share that we can there. On the enterprise side, as we've always said, it takes a bit longer because the sales cycles are a bit longer. We've made very nice progress with all of the top OEMs. I think the portfolios are continuing to expand. We're excited about not just the current portfolio, as you said, with Genoa, but as we expand to Genoa X at the very high end of the performance as well as Ciena that just broadens our portfolio for telco. So our expectation is that we continue to steadily grow share in the enterprise, as well as we go through 2023 and beyond. I think there's a broader opportunity to sell the broader AMD portfolio we have, not just the CPU, but I think the addition of the Xilinx assets and the Pensando assets, as well as our GPU portfolio, I think, all lead to the overall growth in the data center business for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,19,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- As my follow-up, it's a question I would normally ask Devinder, but I've gotten a few emails on it in the last hour. So I figure I'd go ahead and ask it. The revenue, obviously, including Xilinx, up 70% or so year on year, but A few people have pointed out to me that the cash flow or the free cash flow was only up a tiny bit or very, very modestly. And I wonder if you could walk us through that a little bit where the one-time items with inventory step-up with acquisitions, where maybe more investments in supply. I'm just wondering what the variables are there on expanding the free cash flow leverage as we go forward.Devinder KumarYes. I can do that. I think, one, is when the revenue grows a lot, there's investment leader in working capital. So working capital numbers from an inventory and AR standpoint, they're up significantly year on year. We also have, as we said previously, a 3% tax rate going up to about 10%. And the cash taxes get paid. But the timing of the cash taxes sometimes is Q2. And in Q2, we did have some significant cash tax payment from a payment standpoint given the timing of payments of the federal government. And then you have timing of shipments that does affect the free cash flow. And the last thing I'll mention given the discussion, some of the questions that Lisa was asked about, supply for server and supply overall with the share gain of the growth of the business. We are making investments in capacity from a prepayment standpoint, and those obviously require funding the suppliers, and that also has an impact on the free cash flow because that flows through the free cash flow accretion. So this is really, if you look at it, inventory and capacity investing for growth and investing for the future.

I wish you the best. I guess, for my first question, I wanted to maybe try and unpack the data center business a little bit more. I apologize to kind of continue to go there. But as I look at the trends over the last couple of quarters, and especially given the unit decline that we saw at your largest competitor in this last quarter, I'm curious if you could help us appreciate the trajectory of what you're seeing from a blended overall pricing perspective within your server CPU business. Just trying to appreciate as we get into Genoa or Bergamo as we move into 2023. How should we think about the ASP trend on a blended basis within the server CPUs?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

So, Aaron, I guess what I would say there is -- Genoa has much more content than Milan, right? If you think of Milan, it's Rome and Milan are 64 core processors. And as you get into Genoa and Bergamo, you get to 96 and 128 cores. So you would expect on a per unit basis that the ASP would go up. That being the case, I think we would expect that Milan is going to coexist with Genoa and Bergamo for quite some time, just given sort of the different infrastructure and so on and so forth.

So we continue to make good progress in the data center GPU. The key there for us is to work with some of the large hyperscalers who have been very closely partnering with us on our MI200 product. I think from an overall revenue standpoint, it's not a big contributor this year.

So actually, I would say that the Xilinx business has performed extremely well. The demand across all segments has been strong. And what we were able to do as we brought Xilinx into the portfolio is really make some significant improvements in the supply chain. And so we have seen a nice step up. If you were to look on a pro forma basis the Xilinx portfolio grew about 20% sequentially, which is a very nice growth. As we look into the second half of the year, we are still a bit constrained in certain areas, certain parts of the Xilinx portfolio, although we continue to make good progress, and I expect additional supply to come on, especially toward the latter part of the year and into 2023. Our view of the business, again, I think the quality of the design wins, the quality of the overall -- when you look -- the diverse market is very strong. And so I think as we are able to continue to relieve some of those supply constraints into the second half of the year, I think see a good growth trajectory for the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then as a follow-up on -- just wondering how you think about competition in microprocessors in the context of -- for the last four years, either you or Intel has generally been constrained, Intel for a couple of years than you for the last couple of years. As those constraints ease and obviously, Intel utilization probably falls a little bit here. Could you talk about what you anticipate pricing wise? Do you think anything changes? Or does this continue to be kind of a value-priced market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 2, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,27,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I think, Joe, it is -- I mean, we always assume that it's going to be a very competitive market. I think it depends a little bit on where you're talking about within the market. But on the data center side, what we have found is pricing is not sort of the first factor that customers are paying attention to. It's really total cost of ownership. So the performance and the sort of the performance per dollar equation is very important there and sort of the power efficiency. As we go into the PC market, we've deliberately focused our PC market on, let's call it, the more premium segments. So gaming as well as high end sort of the ultra-premium, as well as the commercial segments. And again, I think those are much more about the product. There are some parts of the PC market that are very price sensitive, like the low end. And like I said, we've tried to reduce our exposure there going forward. So I think -- I don't think the dynamics change a lot. I think it's always a very competitive market and the key thing there is to have a very strong roadmap.

If I look at the spreadsheet that Saresh sent around with the restated data center numbers. And it looks like your data center business kind of aligns apples-to-apples to Intel's pretty closely. It looks like you guys gained 6.6% share from Intel. And if I kind of take a guess about the pro forma contribution of Xilinx, what it would have been in Q1, it's about 6% share gain. And that would be -- I think that would be the highest share gain in that data center business that you guys ever reported even going back to 2005. Admittedly, two-thirds of that is from Intel declining. I guess since that would put you against until, I guess, in the like kind of the mid-20s, and I'm curious if you think that math sounds about right to you. And I'm hoping that you could because we're grouping more things together, if you could just share with us, was there any outsized contribution from Xilinx or Pensando or something like that and that, that would make that look -- that might change the interpretation from what it looks like on the service because that's a pretty big jump in share? So that's the first part of the question. I had a follow-up, too.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

So this is sort of the reason that we went to the new segments so that there was better visibility. I know you guys have been asking about that for a while. So I think your math is in the ZIP code from our point of view. And we're pleased that we're gaining share. I think that was our expectation was that as the product portfolio expands, as we increase supply, as we ramp more instances across the customer set that we would see share gains. And we will continue to focus on that going forward. To your question, there was no outsized contribution. The other pieces of it that are in the segment are relatively small, and it was primarily driven by EPYC as you state.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then the follow-up, if I may. I just wanted to come back to the visibility on this business. And I'm wondering like about the kind of like the variance that you get from your cloud customers. So I guess, the scenario that I'm curious about is, I imagine the cloud, a lot of the cloud companies do a lot of planning on their data center since it is central to their business. And they sign a data center lease that's going to get built in six months. Do they -- after they do that, do they come to you guys and say, hey, this is coming online. We need to get these chips from you in six months and how consistent and how tight is the variance span around the visibility that they give you guys?

Mark, actually it has been very helpful. I mean, I think the planning that we're doing jointly with our customers has been very helpful. Much of our conversation right now, frankly, is about 2023, and ensuring that we have enough capacity for some of the build-outs that are out there. So I would say the visibility is very good. And obviously, things can change, plus or minus here and there. But overall, I think the ZIP codes of how much growth, how much more content the customers need are very active conversations. And frankly, they've been active conversations for the past few months. I think the one positive of sort of the supply chain stuff that we've all gone through is that there's a new recognition of the need for long-term planning so that they can get their match sets and they can get their factory capacity and we can get our factory capacity in line as well.

Morgan -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Congratulations on the solid results and execution. On the ramp of Genoa back half of this year, kind of early next year, I believe the team has a total of around 20-plus SKUs across their cloud enterprise and embedded customers. Your cloud customers obviously are anxiously awaiting these platforms. Would you be rolling out your high-volume cloud SKUs first? And what's the qualification look like on these high-volume SKUs? Just asking because, obviously, your competitor is struggling with SKU releases, and I just want to make sure that the AMD team is executing and releasing its high-volume SKUs to your cloud customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

So we certainly go through a full, again, interlock with our customers. Our focus is on the high-volume cloud SKUs, as well as sort of the high-volume enterprise SKUs because there is a fairly sort of lengthy qualification cycle that's actually in both the cloud and the enterprise. From what we see today, again, there is a strong customer pull on Genoa. And so we're working very closely with our customers, and we expect to ramp production in the fourth quarter and then into the first half of next year. And it will be different by different customers and different platforms and so on and so forth. But what we're seeing is a lot of strong engagement with our customers.

It seems like maybe if you take the lost units and you multiply by ASP, it seems like it costs you maybe $750 million, but you kept the full year. And data center seem pretty in line. So is really the offset that you're getting better supply at Xilinx? Is that really the story? And then I have a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2022-earnings-call-t/

No. I wouldn't say that, Tim. What I would say is that, again, whenever we put together full-year guidance especially from the beginning of the year, we understand that not everything is going to be exactly so. So as we look now into the second half of the year, what we're seeing is, again, data center is strong. Again, we expect data center to grow second half to first half nicely. Embedded/Xilinx will also grow to some extent, second half to first half. And the consoles will also grow as well. And so I think as we look at those components offsetting what is perhaps a more conservative PC outlook, we believe that, that offsets nicely. And again, just as a reminder, we do have a number of product ramps in the fourth quarter that are coming out in 5-nanometer, we think that will drive sort of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter.

Good afternoon. Congratulations, Lisa on, obviously, getting Xilinx closed and the strong results. I guess there's a lot going on from a macro perspective in the markets that you serve and in the supply chains, Lisa. So I mean, in the first half of the year, I think you're doing, I don't know, 54%, 55% organic growth in the first quarter. Maybe you could talk me through a bit the puts and takes in the quarter. I think there's a perception that you have additional supply coming online. There's obviously supply constraints and lockdowns in China. Your Server business doing extraordinarily well in the numbers that you just printed and then maybe some perception of a softening in the PC market. So there's a lot going on, and I'd kind of love you to walk me through the puts and takes of the quarter, if you could.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,2,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So we did have a very strong first quarter. There is a lot going on, without a doubt, in the business. I would say, if you look at the strength in our business in the first quarter, it was really broad-based. So very, very strong Server results. We continue to gain share. We continue to bring more supply online there. Also, very strong results in our Semi-Custom or game console business, as well as in the Client and Graphics businesses. There is some softness in the PC market. But we had, for the last number of quarters, actually been shifting our mix to the higher end or the more premium segments of the PC market, and so that's where more of our exposure is. And we actually saw significant growth in our PC business sequentially as we started ramping our Ryzen 6000 notebooks. And that resulted in strong ASP growth, as well as just our key market segments of premium, commercial and gaming being covered there. As we go forward, obviously, all of the things that you talked about are in play. That being the case, I think we've managed through the supply situations very well. We continue to work with our customers and ensure that we're optimizing our builds to their builds. And with the addition of Xilinx, we also have another set of end markets that have very strong demand that are all additive to our business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- Got it. I appreciate all the color. I guess as my follow-up question, I wanted to examine the full year guidance that you've given. Obviously, it includes Xilinx so it's a little bit apples and oranges from last year. But I think in the press release, you guys mentioned that you expect some upside from the original 31% organic growth guidance. If you have any comments on magnitude there, that would be helpful. And then, I think just what investors would love to hear from you is maybe your view on the data center capex spending environment and also on the PC market. I think you guys had been maybe a bit more conservative than some of your competition in your market commentary about PCs maybe being flattish coming into this year. I imagine there's some new puts and takes to that. So just some thoughts on how you guys constructed the guidance for the year, especially relative to the original 31% would be really helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,4,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So lots of questions in there, Matt, so let me try to go through them. So first on the full year 2022 guide, it is a significant increase in guidance, up 60%. There are a couple of pieces to that. On the organic side of the AMD business, we originally guided up 31% based on what we saw in the market in January. As we look at the market now and our own sort of customer and supply situation, we see that organic growth higher, into the mid-30s. That's primarily driven by very strong demand in our Server business, very strong demand in our Console or Semi-Custom business, additional supply coming online. We have taken a bit more of a conservative perspective on the PC market. Again, I think the softness is in certain parts of the market. It's not in all parts of the market. And our focus is on where we add the most value in the market and that is in the premium segments. In terms of the Xilinx piece of it, the full year addition, 3.5 quarters of Xilinx is a significant add. On a pro forma basis, the Xilinx business is also growing very well, and it's growing sort of like in the low 20s, if you consider full year compared to calendar year 2021. So overall, I think we have a lot -- a broad-based set of growth drivers and multiple levers for growth as we go through the year. And we continue to work on working with our customers on where the demand is and ensuring that we're satisfying that demand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

I had two questions myself. I guess, first on the supply chain situation, Lisa. Obviously, there's a lot going on in terms of wafer supply and substrates and now the China lockdowns. What are some of the bigger pain points for you? And to the extent the China lockdowns are impacting your business directly or indirectly, are you assuming any impact to revenue and profitability in the second quarter?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,7,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So on the supply environment, we've been working on this really for the last 18 months. We've made a lot of progress on both the wafer side and significant investments on the substrates. I would say that we continue to get sort of very good support from our suppliers. That's one of the reasons we can increase our guidance the way it is. From an overall -- you mentioned the China COVID situation. From our standpoint, we haven't had any significant impact on our own shipments in our own supply chain. We have been working with some customers that have had some customer build delays and that is contemplated in our second quarter guidance. We're going to continue to work on supply optimization with the addition of Xilinx, some of the, let's call it, more mature nodes. 16-nanometer and above wafer supply is still somewhat constrained. We're working with sort of the larger scale of AMD to try to bring more supply on board there, as well as continuing to ramp our overall capacity to support a very strong sort of next few quarters. Hopefully, that answered your supply questions.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,8,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes, for sure. And then my second question, my follow-up question was on the data center business. It's great to hear that you've decided to resegment your business, so thank you for that. Curious how meaningful data center was as a percentage of revenue in the quarter, server CPU, data center GPU and now FPGAs from Xilinx. And I guess, more importantly, how are you thinking about the medium- to long-term opportunity in both your classic data center GPU business, as well as the FPGA business. I think in data center GPU, you mentioned that it was flat in the quarter but you also talked about being engaged with more cloud customers. So curious what you're seeing there. And then on the FPGA side, I think Victor and team, prior to the deal announcement, was pretty vocal about the long-term growth opportunity there as well. So any update from your perspective would be great.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,9,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Right, OK. So again, a few pieces to that. Let me try to give you some color and then maybe Victor will add on the FPGA side. So in terms of -- yes, we are going to change our segment reporting, as Devinder said, as of the second quarter to be -- to give you -- to more alignment to the markets. In terms of this quarter for the pieces that you mentioned, on higher revenue, the data center for those pieces was, let's call it, low 20s percentage of our overall revenue. And then, in terms of the longer-term data center picture, we are incredibly excited opportunity in data center. When you look at the pieces we have now, I mean, the CPU franchise is very strong, continuing to get stronger. We're excited with how Genoa looks and how Bergamo looks and sort of the engagements with customers there. We're excited about the GPU portfolio as well. GPUs for us are a longer-term sort of road map, similar to what we did on the CPU side. We had been more focused on, let's call it, supercomputing and HPC, so that was strong for us last year and that's why we're flattish year on year. We're very engaged on the AI front now, continuing our investments in our software stack and working with cloud guys to optimize our software stack. And then, moving on to FPGAs and then also our adaptive SoCs and then the Pensando acquisition. I think what we now have is just an incredibly strong portfolio when we're dealing with whether you're talking about the largest cloud hyperscalers or you're talking about enterprise. And then with Pensando and Xilinx, it also gives us exposure to the edge as well. And so, between -- we have all the compute engines and are able to optimize that. So I think you should expect to hear a lot more from us in the data center, certainly is -- at our financial analyst day but really strong opportunities there. Maybe Victor, you want to add on to?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

I think you covered it well. The only thing I would add is just, again, I think not only do we have a really broad portfolio of all the compute engines but we're doubling down on the networking side, right? Since we had strength in that in SmartNIC and then with Pensando, the kind of solutions that we could provide to customers in the overall infrastructure, right? It's not about point things, it's about the total solution. And as you probably know, scale out and just a lot of these applications, you could be thralled by the network so we really can optimize all of it. And the customers really want optimized, customized solutions. And I think that's what we could do with both the former Xilinx SmartNIC, as well as Pensando even going further.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, my first one is on the Server market. Milan helped you take and continues to help you take a lot of share in the market. I'm curious, what's the state of play in front of the next-gen Genoa versus the Sapphire Rapids server cycle from two perspectives? First, just from the industry adoption of DDR5, can that be a bottleneck to adoption of these next-generation servers? And second perspective is that you will have two different flavors of Genoa with the cloud-optimized version coming later. So just give us your sense of how this next-generation cycle plays out versus the very strong success you've had with Milan so far.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,14,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, absolutely, Vivek. So the way to think about it is the data center market and particularly in servers, people are getting much more optimized for workloads, and so there are different flavors. And we see that even in Milan today with Milan and our Milan-X, X3D -- the X3D we introduced. And so, I think it's natural for these solutions to sit side by side. I think as you go into Genoa, the next-generation platform, we would expect, again, the adoption -- there's a lot of excitement on Genoa and there's a lot of customer demand for Genoa. I do expect that Genoa will sit, again, side-by-side with Milan for quite some time because you're not going to move the infrastructure instantaneously over. And then when you think about Bergamo, which is the cloud-optimized, I think that will be more specific for specific large hyperscalers who have the need for, let's call it, a more performance per dollar, performance per watt solution. So the way to think about this, Vivek, is as our business has grown, we can invest more broadly and that will give us just a more optimized solution for our customers' TAMs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then Lisa, my second question, kind of two or three interrelated question on the PC market. So what is your new sense of what the PC TAM can be this year versus what you thought before? And then I think as part of that, your competitor has mentioned several times that they are back in the market with Alder Lake and they are taking a lot of share, so I'm wondering what you have seen there. And then finally, what's your share in the commercial market today versus what it was last year? So just something on TAM, competition and commercial exposure.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,16,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Vivek, when we kind of started the year, we were thinking that the PC TAM could be flat to, let's call it, down, let's call it, low mid-single digits. I think given sort of how we've started this year and then some of the other things in the market, we're taking a more conservative approach to the PC TAM. So for our modeling for the full year guidance, we're modeling something like down high single digits. Now, a lot of things can happen between now and then, so I would say that I think that's a good place for us to model. Within that, we've always been very focused on where we can add the most value and the premium segments, Ryzen 6000, our Rembrandt product, is extremely well positioned from a battery life or performance standpoint. We have a number of commercial, very good systems that are in the process of being launched. I think we're excited about that. To your question about commercial share, we're still underrepresented in the commercial market, and we know that and that's a focus area for us. I think overall, from a market share standpoint, we believe we're focused in the right segments. And so, even under the backdrop of, let's call it, a softer PC market, that we will -- we can continue to expect to gain revenue share in the process. And that's sort of our overall strategy. But I think the other piece of it is we have so many levers in the business now as we go forward. I think the strength in the business is really looking at the overall data center portfolio, the PC portfolio, the gaming portfolio and the Xilinx portfolio together, there are lots of levers for growth. And as we go through this year, we see that being very helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,25,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the questions. I'll stick to two, if I can. I guess my first question as we think about the Server market and your share gains, but more importantly, we also think about the proliferation or expansion of the product portfolio. I'm curious of just what you're seeing from a competitive perspective and your thoughts around continuing to mix higher in terms of the server market, thinking about the blended ASP trends in your Server business. How should we think about that as we think about Milan-X, Genoa, I guess, Bergamo thereafter, just that trend looking forward?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,26,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So Aaron, obviously, it depends on the mix between cloud and enterprise. But in general, as we offer more value, let's call it, more performance, more capability, we would expect our ASPs to mix up. And in any given quarter, it's more of a what is the cloud versus enterprise mix. But look, I'm very pleased with the fact that we're growing both cloud and enterprise very substantially. So I think that tells you that we're growing across the entire Server market. And we're going to continue to, let's call it, optimize products so that, one, our customers get more capability and we get more value for our technology.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,27,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- And then the second quick question is on the capacity discussion. I'm curious as you bring Xilinx into the model, you scale the business going forward, how could we think about flexibility from a perspective of capacity? If PCs slow down, can your capacity be fungible and move that capacity over to servers or even Xilinx capacity into Server CPUs? I'm just curious of how we should think about that ability to mix across product segments as you think about your wafer capacity agreements.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,28,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Aaron, the way to think about that is, so both the Xilinx portfolio and sort of the organic AMD portfolio do use TSMC, so we are complementary there as our primary wafer supplier. We use very similar substrate suppliers as well. The Xilinx portfolio tends to be on more mature nodes. Although there is some 7-nanometer, the majority of the portfolio is on 16-nanometer and above. So I would say there's not that much fungibility there. However, on the back end, on the substrate side, there is very good fungibility across the portfolio. And from the standpoint of overall supply, I think you've heard it from Devinder. I mean, we have invested significantly over the last 18 months in sort of securing the supply and capacity and we're seeing it come online. And that's, again, what I'd like to do is, as you see it come online, that's when it will go into our revenue forecast. But I feel very good about the progress that we're making. And we're continuing to dimension the company for just a much larger business. And so, it's a lot of supply that we're bringing online. We're working very much with Victor and his team as well because he has a strong backlog and strong demand, and we're looking to use all of the AMD assets to also accelerate some of his builds.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

So Harlan, thanks. So we've made great progress on the cloud side, so we have strong adoption on internal, as well as external-facing workloads. We've also made strong progress on the Enterprise. I mean, as you said, all major OEMs have EPYC throughout the portfolio. And in this past quarter and in general, we've grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as a cloud business. We're still cloud-weighted but I believe that it's going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

And then maybe a question for you or for Victor, but when I think about the embedded markets, auto, industrial, aerospace and defense, comm infrastructure, consumer, just given the strong market positioning here by Xilinx, I mean, they're in a good position to catalyze EPYC-attached, to catalyze Ryzen-attached to their FPGA solutions. So maybe Victor can help us understand, like what percentage of Xilinx FPGA solutions in the Embedded market sits next to either an x86 or high-performance ARM processor because I think that the process opportunity in Embedded is much larger than the FPGA opportunity. And I believe that Embedded is a pretty small percentage of overall business for AMD.

Maybe I'll take this one. I agree with you. Actually, one of the things that -- many things that's really exciting since we joined AMD is we've done some customer visits and they're really excited about exactly that point. We have a broader portfolio and processors and even in some areas in the GPUs. It's also of great interest, the Embedded business at [Inaudible] has been selling APUs and Embedded versions of both the Server, as well as the Client kind of products. And now with the FPGAs and adaptive SoCs we have, we really can give a much more complete solution. And so, that is definitely on the menu of things in terms of revenue synergies, which we'll discuss more at the financial analyst day.

Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I think maybe an easier way for investors to have thought about AMD historically, particularly more recently, is you've been successful in delivering server CPUs for data processing in the data center. And I think people, or at least I have thought about Xilinx historically doing networking and communications solutions for base stations, as well as data centers, and they've kind of moved into this adaptive computing mode where they're doing more data processing also. And I wonder, you've seen other companies with general purpose computing solutions kind of adding communications capability. And I'm wondering, is there an opportunity for more data processing at the network edge, like say, at the base station where Xilinx has historically been really strong? And do you think the solutions, the architecture that you would have at the base station for the combination of data and communications network processing, do you think that ultimately, it looks very similar to what you see deep in the hyperscale data centers deep in the cloud?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,37,Lisa Su,Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Sure, Mark. So I think the answer is yes, and maybe I'll generalize it a bit more. We're a big believer. I mean, the whole strategy behind AMD is to have the best sort of compute engines and then put them together in -- sort of in solutions for specific end markets. So I think our CPUs, GPUs, the FPGAs, the adaptive SoCs and then the DPU that we're adding from Pensando give us just a tremendous range of capability. So to your specific question in sort of comms infrastructure, I definitely think there's a strong opportunity there. As Victor mentioned, we've been to a number of our joint large customers, and there is absolute interest in trying to put these solutions together. And more broadly, though, I think what we see in terms of growth going forward, there will be more customization around solutions for large -- for these large customers, whether it's cloud customers or large telcos or even some edge opportunities. And having these compute engines will allow us to basically optimize those solutions together. So we look forward to telling you sort of a lot more about sort of how we're thinking about these road maps as we go into our financial analyst day in June.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

You'll see us unify that, and that will be an important part of our road map going forward. And to your open source point, we do believe in open source.

Congrats on the strong quarter and closing the Xilinx deal. Lisa, just again, a lot of moving parts, you've said that a bunch of times so forgive me if I dive into them a little bit. But as we think about your second quarter guide, I just wanted to get some of the moving parts that you're assuming there. Because I take up the Xilinx side or just give you the full quarter of it and a little bit of guidance there, it looks like the core AMD is kind of growing low single digits sequentially. You've mentioned about the PC side seeing some weakness. You've talked about that a bunch and then the strength in the Server and the Semi-Custom side. So any sort of color about the puts and takes to get you that organic growth.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So for the second quarter, in particular, the second quarter guide is driven by sort of one is the full quarter of the Xilinx business and strength in our Server business primarily as we see the second quarter. There are other puts and takes, I would call them, on the smaller side of that. If you recall, I mean, if you think about whether you talk about the PC business or the gaming business, they tend to be more second half weighted. So the second quarter doesn't tend to be a strong quarter for those businesses, and so that's not the driver of the sequential increase.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 4, 2022","March 31, 2022.",1,43,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Perfect. And I guess a similar question, a perfect segue in your answer there. When I think about the full year guide, obviously, incredibly impressive. You talked about the organic increases. But it looks like, especially with that extra week, that you're kind of going up low -- or mid- to high single digits in one of those quarters and kind of flattish after that just to get to the full year. So a similar sort of question. What are the puts and takes there? Is the PC seasonality something you're kind of leaning against a little bit relative to the high single-digit drop you've talked about where you guys will still grow but maybe not as fast as in years past, given that backdrop? Or is there something else that plateaus out in the second half?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

What I would say, though, is if I give you sort of the puts and takes of the second half of the year, the -- again, we expect that the Server business will continue to grow. As we said, good visibility there. We expect the Console business to grow in the second half versus the first half also, that's typical seasonality. Typical seasonality in PCs would also have the second half higher than the first half. I think we're modeling for a little bit sub-seasonal, just given sort of all the puts and takes in the market there. And then, we expect the Xilinx business to also grow in the second half as more supply comes online, given the strong demand. So if you see all those pieces, I don't think there's a plateau. I think it's a continued improvement as we see one, strong demand and also more supply coming online in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

We're still in a place, if you were to look into the retail channel, you would say that the demand is underserved today in the Semi-Custom business. And their real build is toward holidays. So the answer is we do believe that Semi-Custom will be at a record for us this year. We have more content. We also have the Valve Steam Deck that also has gotten very strong reviews and is ramping as we go into the second half of the year. And then on 2023, I do believe that 2023 will be another strong year for Semi-Custom and would be up. And again, if you look at the history of these ramps, it's really around the fourth year that you see -- that you really see the business kind of hit its peak. In addition to that, just knowing some of the game releases that are -- from a software standpoint, that are coming out, there are -- there's -- obviously, there's a good line of [Inaudible] there's also an expected strong lineup as we go forward. So yes, that's our current view of the Semi-Custom business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

And I guess just following up on the overall Server market. I know that you're not the best read because you're gaining so much market share. But there have been some comments from some of the big cloud customers about ""moderating or slowing"" investment. And there's some debate about does that mean that there's going to be some slowdown in procurement of servers. So if you strip out your sort of share gain, I'm curious of your assessment of just overall strength in the data center market. Do you see it slowing at all later on this year or even into next year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to get your perspective on the AI silicon markets. And you've obviously focused on HPC with MI200s and you've got CPU road map on the Server side. That's a big host processor for AI. But can you share with us how we should think about AMD in the next sort of two, three years around -- it is like AI training, it is like inference, particularly the GPU portfolio, MI300, etc.? And when do you think this platform is really going to be able to sort of compete and win in the AI training and inference space?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/04/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2022-earnings-call-t/

Let me start, Brett, and then I'll ask Victor to also make some comments. No question, AI is a huge opportunity for us and it's one where we're thinking about it very holistically in terms of how we address. So on the Server CPU side, a lot of inference is done on the Server CPU side. We've been investing in that area, on the GPU side for both training and inference. There are a lot of around the software stack, and so our focus is on optimizing our software stack with our large cloud customers and partners. And then, what Xilinx brings to our portfolio is actually a lot of capability on the AI inference side, in their current portfolio and then additive to the AMD portfolio. So I think you'll see a much broader set of offerings from us in AI as we start talking about sort of the broader product road maps.

I mean, look, we've been -- we have this AI engine that is already deployed in production in a number of embedded applications and endpoints and also edge devices like in cars, that are doing a lot of image recognition, all kinds of inference applications, and that same architecture can be scaled and brought into the CPU product portfolio. And as we've alluded to, that is exactly our plan. We're also -- a moment ago, as a discussion about software, we're absolutely working on the unified overall software to enable the broad portfolio but also especially in AI. So you'll hear more about that at the financial analyst day, but we're definitely going to be leaning in, in AI both inference and training, and I would say, end-to-end because we have endpoints, we have edge devices, both computing and embedded devices and in the cloud and enterprise.

We also have, with the acquisition of Pensando, they have a very strong software team and effort around their DPUs and what we can do there. So I think as a total, you should see us investing a lot more in software. And then in terms of the monetization and stuff, I think we can address that more as we think about the overall solution space that we'll be offering across all of these compute engines.

Thanks for taking the question, and congratulations on the quarter. Just thinking about the full year, you know, guidance. I know that you had mentioned in your prepared remarks that you expect the semi-custom segment to grow. I'm curious if you could help us maybe appreciate how you're thinking about the semi-custom segment relative to the server segment and whether or not that 30% contribution from total data center still applies for 2023, the outlook that you had provided at the last Analyst Day, or you think that we're tracking above that trend?

Thanks for the question. So for 2022, I mean, our current view is that we'll see growth in all of our businesses. You know, we see strong demand for our products, as well as, you know, we have increased supply capability, given what we've done with our partners. So relative to the growth from the different businesses, the growth will be led by server. So from what we see from customers and design wins and platforms and all that, you know, server will be very strong next year. But we also expect growth from our other businesses, including consoles, including our PC business, our graphics business, and our embedded business.

Good afternoon. For the whole team, but Lisa, congrats on getting close on Xilinx. Excited to see what that brings, and obviously the strong results. The -- one of the questions I'm getting tonight is -- with such a strong start, greater than 30% guidance for revenue in 2022, can you just kind of walk us through maybe with a little more specificity, some of the things that you've done in the supply chain around substrate, around back-end test and package, around wafer demand, and just to give people comfort that there's coverage there and visibility and the potential for upside, particularly as you take server and desktop on the five nanometer. I imagine, seven-nanometer capacity won't go away. It will stay as that new capacity comes online. So I just want to make sure I understand all the variables around the confidence in supply. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for the question. So, you know, we've been working on sort of the supply chain really for the last four or five quarters knowing the growth that we have from a product standpoint and the visibility that we have from customers. So in regards to your question on 2022 supply environment, we've made significant investments in, you know, wafer capacity, as well as substrate capacity and back-end capacity. We feel very good about our progress in the supply chain to meet the 2022 guidance and, you know, our goal is, frankly, to have enough supply to satisfy the demand out there. So, you know, our view is we're going to continue to work with our partners and our customers to ensure that we know what they need. And likewise, you know, our capacity investments are for 2022, but also beyond 2022, because as the business grows, we need to continue to forecast and make plans for that, and that's what we've been working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for that. Just as a follow-up, I've been hearing more and more, and as you guys roll out the five-nanometer portfolio, many of those products in server and in desktop will include next-generation Infinity Fabric. And it's been a conversation for a while about what you guys have branded sort of A+ A, AMD CPU, and GPU together. I wonder as you look out over the next several quarters, how -- Lisa, how would you characterize that combination in importance to your company strategy and the growth?

And then the work with the Infinity Fabric really is just on top of that and allows us to continue to optimize, you know, sort of the AMD CPU and GPU ecosystem together. So whether on the data center side, with our data center GPU products, you know, working with EPYC in high-performance computing or on the PC side, when we have our, you know, AMD APUs plus our discrete graphics, you know, plus the software on top.

Congrats on the strong results and the strong guide. Lisa, I just want to talk about the computing segment, the client computing side. At least in my model, that was a significant portion of the upside in the quarter after, I believe, last quarter, you talked about not wanting to fill the channel and make sure you ship according to demand. So in the near term, what changed? And perhaps more importantly, as you look into 2022, it appears that you're planning for significant share gains to continue in that sector. Can you talk a little bit about what gives the confidence for that share gain, please?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Ross. So, you know, your question about the computing and graphics segment. Look, you know, our focus in this segment is to be very closely aligned with our customers and what they're doing in the market. So we've been monitoring, you know, sell-in and sell-out and sell-through trends very carefully. I think the strength that we saw in the fourth quarter was very much a result of, you know, sort of the product strength. And we saw, you know, very nice notebook demand continuing at the premium part of the market in commercial, gaming, premium ultrathin. So we believe that the PC performance was, you know, a bit above our original guidance, but we believe that was to match end-user demand. Going into 2022, you know, again, same story. I think the -- you know, what we see is 2021 was a strong year for PCs. Overall, the industry shipped, you know, approximately 350 million units. I think our view is that 2022 will be roughly flattish from a unit standpoint. But we will see a -- some mix, you know, changes in there with enterprise and premium being stronger than, for example, low end and education. So, you know, from our standpoint, it's revenue share that we believe we can gain. It's the strength of our Ryzen 6000 series that we just launched at CES. We have, you know, 200 platforms from all of the OEM customers, and we have pretty good visibility in working with our customers on that. So -- and I think we feel good about it. You know -- and, again, the client business is one of all of our businesses, you know, will grow. And I like that diversity, frankly, in the portfolio. But we feel good about the progress we've made in PCs, and we'll continue to ensure that we're matching sell-in with sell-out so that there is not inventory build in the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Maybe a quick follow-up on the pricing side of the equation. You talked about getting enough supply to grow the impressive targets that you guys have for the year. Conceptually and strategically, how do you think about pricing? Is that something you pass along? Is it a tailwind to gross margin? And I don't know if you'd give any sort of precision, but out of the 30% plus that you're guiding to for the fiscal year, roughly, how do we think about pricing as a tailwind within that?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,13,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Well, you know, I would say the way to think about pricing is, you know, the industry has seen, you know, some price increases across the supply chain. And, you know, that's as to be expected given the amount of capacity that we're all putting on to satisfy, you know, the strong demand. So, you know, we're always in this for the long-term and working with our supply chain partners, as well as our customers, to ensure that we find a way to kind of share the additional costs. But, you know, our focus is on ensuring that we have the supply to meet the high demand. And, you know, I think what you're seeing is, you know, growth in the model from the standpoint that -- you know, we've always kind of said we're underrepresented in the business. You know, when you look even today with all of our growth, we're still underrepresented in the business, whether you're talking about the server business or the PC business. And so, you know, we believe that our product strength and our, you know, customer engagements are such that we can grow significantly in this environment.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to get your thoughts on the competitive landscape in the server market this year versus last. You know, your competitor at Intel is launching their Sapphire Rapids platform. They seem to be very excited about that. You know, they're adding a lot of capacity in their fabs. Their enterprise spending, which has tended to favor them in the past, right, is also coming back. So I'm just curious, how are you thinking about AMD's ability to gain more share in servers this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Vivek. So, look, we always expect the competitive environment to be very strong and very aggressive, and that's the way we plan our business. That being the case, I think we're, you know, very happy with the growth that we've seen in the business, you know, sort of last year. And as we look forward, you know, we see opportunities in both cloud and enterprise. You know, on the cloud side, we're in -- 10 of the largest hyperscalers in the world are using AMD. As they get familiar with us over multiple generations, they're expanding the workloads that they're using AMD on. So we see that across internal and external workloads. In the enterprise segment, you know, we doubled year over year here in 2021. We continue to add more field support to have more people get familiar with our architecture. We have very strong OEM relationships. So I feel very good about our server trajectory. And, yes, it's very competitive out there, but we think the data center business is a secular growth business. And within that, we can grow significantly faster than the market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

So my follow-up, Lisa, you know, the semiconductor industry just went through a very tough time last year and even into this year, given all the supply shortages. I'm curious, what has that done to help you build, you know, stronger relationships with your customers who are perhaps looking for a more consistent execution on the road map and more reliable sources of supply? So how is, you know, the shortage environment in semis changed the way customers are looking at AMD today than, you know, how they used to look at you historically?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I think, Vivek, the most important thing that we are, you know, sort of working on with our customers is really consistent execution. And so when you look at, you know, the last year and sort of some of the supply demand imbalance, you know, it has actually caused us to work much, much more closely with our customers. I think we have -- you know, we're talking about visibility now, multiple quarters and, in some cases, multiple years out. For the type of capacity that we're talking about for the size of the customers that we're talking to, we need to do that to plan to have the capability to support all of that capability. So, overall, I think we have definitely deepened the relationship with the customers. And by the way, also, we've deepened the relationships with our supply chain partners. So I think the entire sort of -- the entire food chain needs to come together to deliver on the very strong demand that's out there. So, you know, that's certainly what we've been working on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

You know, usually, we're down sequentially, just given normal seasonality, but the demand patterns are such that demand is strong and we have additional supply coming on board, and so that's why we're guiding sequentially up. As it relates to CPU inventory, whether in PCs or in servers, we don't believe there is, you know, any significant inventory of our products, whether at, you know, our customers or sort of in the retailer channel. So from that standpoint, I think we've been watching very carefully the, you know, sell-in and sell-through patterns, and we believe we're matched to end-user demand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Look, I'm extremely excited about Xilinx. I mean, I would say that we very much have been, you know, planning for the integration over this period of time. You know, we've had customers anxious to talk to us about combined road maps. You know, when we think about sort of the technology that they have, it's very complementary to ours, very, very strong team.

Good afternoon, guys. Lisa, thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, a couple of questions. First, I'm wondering if you could just help me better understand the fungibility of your capacity planning throughout the year, i.e., I understand that your view on the PC market this year is sort of flattish with a better mix and you gaining share. But in the event that come mid-year that were to change and perhaps be a little bit worse than thought, do you have the ability to rejigger your sort of supply chain to move toward server and CPU? How does that kind of math work?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,27,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, John. So we've certainly worked very hard to give ourselves fungibility among the various capacity corridors that we have. So we've done, you know, numerous cross qualifications and new factory bring-ups and all of that stuff. So I would say it's not 100% fungible, but there -- you know, it is -- there is an ability to move across the different businesses. And we make that a dynamic allocation decision, you know, sort of like weekly, you know, based on what we see going on. So I think we have a pretty good pulse on the market, and we sort of understand sort of what's going on. And, you know, our customers are giving us signals on a regular basis. And so, I think, we'll be able to manage through, you know, all of the puts and takes as we go through the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then my second question, just on data center and GPU. Where does that factor into kind of your growth expectations for this year? And now that you've created sort of a strong beachhead of EPYC inside the data center, does that help the sales cycle at all to get more GPU penetration?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure. So our data center GPU had a very strong year in 2021. It was, you know, sort of a key year for us as we launched the MI200 family, and we had several large supercomputing wins. This year, for data center GPU, it's about the cloud and about sort of expanding beyond sort of the large HPC wins. You know, I view it as a strategic growth vector for us over the next several years. I think your question is a good one about sort of the pull now that EPYC is very, you know, sort of well established in these accounts. I do think that helps us with data center GPU. But the way to think about it is, you know, this is a long-term investment for us. You know, the hardware is very, very good. We've been investing more in the software. We've been working with our customers to ensure that our toolchain gets them the performance that they need. And so I would say, this is a longer-term driver, but I'm pleased with the progress that we made, you know, certainly through this last year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

I was curious on the EPYC side and the preamble you kept clearly strong trends in cloud, enterprise, and HPC. Just curious on the comp channel. You had a press release recently with Nokia.

It's an area where we're building relationships. And so, you know, I feel good about the progress there but, you know, I would say it's still quite early. And then, you know, you didn't ask this, but just one of the other things with the communications and 5G, you know, as we bring Xilinx into the equation, you know, they also have very deep relationships with a number of these accounts.

I get the inflationary environment, I get your costs are going up, you know, it's fair to pass those along. But of the 31% growth in 2022, how much of a tailwind is pricing? I mean, is it none?

But what I will say is what I said before. Look, we are sharing. You know, as we go through this environment, the key is to have long-term relationships, both on the supply chain side and on the customer side. But, you know, without a doubt, the predominant growth is, you know, products.

For my follow-up, look, I feel really bad about me picking on a 51% gross margin, but I am going to, so I apologize in advance. But I'll be honest, just given the mix seemingly should be getting quite a bit better year over year in 2022 versus 2021, and you're almost sitting at 51%, I mean, even going into Q1 anyway. It's like -- why doesn't that margin go higher? Can you give us some feeling of the drivers, I guess, from where you're sitting right now in Q4 to Q1 guide through the year?

You know, as you heard Lisa talk about semi-custom in Q4 to Q1, you would expect an increase, but it is flattish and, really, it's product mix-dependent, right? I think looking at any particular quarter is sometimes not the way to do it. It's kind of looking at the long-term. You know, we did 48-plus percent in 2020, and we're going to 51% as a guide in 2022. And if you look at it from that standpoint, the margin of the company continues to go up in a very steady way as data center grows, as we get to a better mix of product within the client and graphics business, and that's, I think, the better way to look at it, Stacy.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

I had one for Lisa and one for Devinder, if I may. Lisa, on -- you know, it seems like one of the potential threats to the merchant processor players like yourself is that your own customers are designing their own processors. And I'm wondering, does AMD have a role working with your customers to provide, you know, customized solutions, be it tweaking x86 or co-designing something more specific together hand in hand? You know, I don't know if Xilinx would play a role in that. Could you just talk about what you're doing on -- with your customers on that effort?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, you know, actually, it's a very exciting area. It's, you know, just consider it an evolution of -- you know, we've always had a semi-custom model, like the work that we do with the console guys to design specifically for their application. As we look at the broader set of applications, you know, including some of these data center applications, we do believe that there's a sort of the next leg of the stool in terms of deep customer relationships. So we already do a lot of customization around product SKUs and, you know, specific optimization points, but we can certainly imagine both customer IP or different incarnations of our IP to really optimize because, you know, as these applications end up really requiring so much volume, it really does justify, you know, additional customization for those cases.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Devinder, you know, five, 10 years ago, I don't think a lot of people would have expected to hear you talk about buying back billions of dollars worth of stock, so congratulations on that progress. The question on this topic is, you know, is -- where are -- where is AMD in terms of evolving this recent capital return push into a policy?

Well, I think the strategy is, you know, as we have gotten more scale in the business, we can invest more and we see ways to, you know, further differentiate our product portfolio. So I mean, I think, you know, Milan-X is really, you know, sort of the highest of the highest end. And we see that for, you know, technical computing and some of these EDA workloads that, you know, that does give us a very differentiated product. And then we have the regular Milan product line, we'll have Genoa, and Bergamo is really optimized for cloud. So I do believe it gives us more opportunity to expand from a market share and a footprint standpoint. And I think the broader statement, Chris, is that the data center is so large. There are so many different workloads that you can optimize.

You know, we work that on a regular basis with our customers and our supply chain partners. I would say we have better visibility than we have ever had from a customer demand standpoint.

Just wanted to ask about your embedded business. You know, it's not often talked about, but it's a great market, right, diversified across various end markets, you can also leverage your leading edge and mature portfolio. You've got a pretty good lineup of that FX-based and Ryzen-based processors targeting embedded. You've also gotten some pretty good design win traction in automotive with guys like Tesla. You've got wins in retail with digital signage, wins in networking, IoT edge platforms. And then with Xilinx, you can sort of really leverage their exposure in industrial automotive coming consumer end markets. It's a small part of the business today, but how do you see the embedded opportunity for AMD looking out over the next several years?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 2, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,63,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks for the question, Harlan. Look, I like the embedded business. You know, I've always liked the embedded business. It's a nice, sticky business over many years. It is smaller, but it has grown nicely. And, you know, the volume design wins in automotive and they've now sort of expanded their usage. You know, they've recently expanded their usage over a broader part of their product portfolio. We've focused on networking and storage as key markets. I do think there is a very good synergy with Xilinx in terms of just the customer set and the channels. And so I do see it as a nice grower for us as we go through it, and there's very good reuse from our server products as well as our client products. So we'll talk -- again, we'll talk a little bit more about it as the business gets to more size. And that will be part of, you know, our Financial Analyst Day conversation when we get to that in June.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/02/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking my questions. Just kind of curious, the overall outlook for Q4. So computing graphics being down. I was just curious if that was more the supply. You're still growing sequentially. And obviously, I would assume you prioritize servers. Just kind of curious what you're seeing in the computing graphics market. And is it anything related to supply constraints for you that would be down sequentially or maybe downstream constraints? And then maybe for Devinder. Just curious, you're still growing gross margin. I'm assuming embedded, semi-custom, and service kind of offsetting. So just kind of walk us through the nice increase in gross margin for Q4.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Blayne. Thanks for the question. So as it relates to the fourth quarter and where we are. Look, we're overall very pleased with our performance in terms of the second half of the year. It's playing out about what we expect it to be in the PC market. So as you're asking about computing and graphics. We had seen that the PC market and user demand is strong overall, but there are some matched set constraints in the PC market. And so for that reason, we've called the PC market really flattish. I would not have said down. I would have called it flattish as we look into the fourth quarter. However, as we look overall at the business, I think the data center business has performed very well, and we see strong demand there, and we're continuing to see that. And as well, the console business, overall gaming is also quite strong. And so we see growth in servers and semi-custom as we go into the fourth quarter. And then on the margin dynamics, Devinder, do you want to cover that?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So Q4, you know, it is up slightly based from our guidance, 1 point from Q3, and that's really product mix, higher margin from server, offset by semi-custom revenue also been higher going from Q3 to Q4. So we're very pleased with the progress on the gross margin. As you look at the Q3 results, up 440 basis points from last year, up 80 basis points from last quarter and the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the server, our revenue growing.

Lisa, how are you feeling about the spending environment in the data center as you look over the next several quarters? And especially your server road map versus the competition because they are planning to launch several new and important products early next year. So I was just wondering how you're thinking about the competitive landscape and the spending landscape over the next year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So thanks, Vivek, for the question. I think overall, we're feeling very, very good about the server business or the data center market. I think from a market standpoint, we've seen a strong market year in 2021 in both cloud and enterprise and we see that continuing into 2022. I think from a competitive position standpoint, I think Milan is extremely well-positioned. So we were very pleased with sort of the adoption rate of Milan. We said that we expected it to grow faster than Rome, and it has. And so the crossover with Milan and Rome in the third quarter is an important metric for that. Going into the fourth quarter, we continue to see a strong environment. And then as the competitive environment goes into 2022, we always expect the competition to be strong, but our focus has been consistent execution of our road map, and we feel very good about Zen 4 and Genoa in 2022. I think we feel very good about the competitive positioning there. And we continue to believe that data center is the most strategic part of our business, and we're making good progress with our customers and partners.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, Lisa, AMD has done very well in terms of gaining share at the hyperscalers. Where are you in that journey? Is there still a lot of share gains to be had at hyperscalers? And importantly, can you repeat that in the enterprise? Or do you think your competitors' incumbency limits the share gain opportunity in the enterprise? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So Vivek, what I would say there is, our business has been more cloud weighted with the hyperscalers than enterprise, that continued here in the third quarter. I do believe that there is significant additional opportunity for us in the cloud. So as we work with these partners, it is about sort of expansion of workloads. Really, there's more tailoring of workloads, as well as we go forward. And then there's also just more customers and broader penetration in both Tier 1 and Tier 2 cloud guys. So I think that's a good market for us. On the enterprise side, I would say, we saw a very strong enterprise quarter here in the third quarter. I think the strength of Milan with our OEMs in terms of the breadth of the platforms, is very good, and we're seeing a good traction with sort of Fortune 1000 companies. So I would say, overall, I think we see a growth trajectory for both our cloud and enterprise business. I think in the enterprise, the key thing has been to get more familiarity with EPYC, and we've made very good progress there. And so I feel very good about where that's going.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

I did want to ask a question specifically on your server business in China. Your competitor called out China and some of the turmoil that's gone over there as a reason why some of their cloud business had some headwinds in the third quarter. And maybe you could comment on how you see spending over the last quarter and then in the next couple of quarters, specifically in that end market in China. And then I have a follow-up. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, again, what I would say is our data center business performed very well in the third quarter, that was across both cloud and enterprise. And in cloud, that was across geographies. So we haven't seen anything particular as it relates to China or there. What I would say is we continue to work with the breadth of customers. And we're in the process of really rolling out sort of broader adoption across the customer set. So I think we saw a pretty normal environment for demand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

As my follow-up, kind of unrelated. You guys mentioned in the comments, still plans to get the Xilinx deal closed by the end of the year. And I think that's important as then there's a lot of things that you can talk about more, maybe more openly about the heterogeneous compute strategy for the business over the long term. Lisa, maybe you could walk us through to the extent that you can talk about it, obviously, there are some things that you can't talk about. But to the extent you can, what milestones you've achieved behind the scenes that make you feel confident, and what hurdles are still there to have the confidence? I mean I guess we've got weeks till we get into the month of December and things kind of slow down a little bit regulatory-wise. So I just wonder what gives the confidence that we can get there and what we should expect. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So look, we've been working diligently on the closure of the Xilinx acquisition. I would say we're through the vast majority of what we need to do in the regulatory front. We're finishing up here. And there's very good progress on the integration side. So we've done a lot on the integration. I think we're excited with the plans that we have. And then on the regulatory front, again, as I said in the prepared remarks, we've made good progress, and we believe we're on track to close at the end of the year. Operator Thanks.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,19,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question and congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I had two questions as well. First, on your outlook for 2022. I realize it's early, and I certainly don't expect you guys to provide a point estimate. But I think people are kind of concerned that you've been sort of overgrowing, if you will, relative to your long-term growth rate. You grew 45% last year. You're on track to grow 65% this year, given your long-term through-cycle growth target of 20%. Again, there is concern that you could decelerate going into next year, given PC dynamics and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth. So, again, I don't expect you to give any quantification of next year, but if you could describe the year qualitatively, what are the potential pluses and minuses at this point, that would be super helpful? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,20,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So look, as you said, it's a little bit early to talk about quantitatively. I'll cite qualitatively, what we see is, look, we see a positive demand environment. And that's a market statement, but that's also an AMD statement, right? I think the strength of our product portfolio has multiple growth vectors. Data center continues to be a very important one for us. I think we're -- we continue to make progress in the graphics market, and we think graphics is a good growth vector. Our console business, we would expect would be -- I mentioned earlier that it'd be up in the fourth quarter, and we would expect it to be up in 2022, just given the strength of the demand environment there. And so on the PC side, the comments I'll make on the PC side are -- the end-user demand appears to be strong. So there's a good amount of refresh going on, whether you're talking about consumer and your high-end consumer or commercial or gaming. There are some supply constraints around matched sets that we believe will continue into the first half of the year. That being the case, what we're using from a planning assumption standpoint, is that the PC market may be flattish as we go from 2021 into 2022. But even within that environment, we think there are opportunities for us to continue to grow. So, overall, I think we're very focused on execution, very focused on working with our customers to make sure that we're aligned with what they need and overall feel very good about our product portfolio going into 2022.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

That's super helpful. Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, a similar question on gross margins. I'm not sure if this is for Lisa or Devinder. You're guiding Q4 to 49.5%, which is obviously significant progress from a year ago. Given some of the dynamics you've talked about whether it be the growth potential in server CPU, the mix within server CPU, and I'm sure the mix dynamics on the client side, I think most of us do expect a pretty nice positive trajectory into 2022, potentially with a five handle in terms of, again, gross margins. But any risks or any headwinds that we should be aware of? I think your foundry partner is raising pricing. There is cost inflation generally across the board, but any risk items that we should think about at this point? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

As Lisa said, with the growth factors that we have, we expect to continue making progress from where we are currently and especially predicated on the competitive leadership products we have. We're very pleased with the progress we've made over the last few years. But without getting to specifics, I think you can assume that we continue to make progress with the mix of revenue, mix of products, and the competitive products that we are introducing also into 2022.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

But can you give us an approximate feeling for how big that is it? Are we still talking like tens of millions of dollars? Or is it larger than that? And what are your expectations for how that's going to ramp as Frontier and some of the other supercomputers that a lot of that stuff is going into our ramping over the next like couple of years?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So Stacy, on the data center GPU side, the third quarter was a larger quarter for the data center GPU. This is where we shipped the Frontier shipments that are now in the build cycle. It is still a relatively small business compared to the CPU side. So our expectation is that going into the fourth quarter, it's a lumpy business for us. So Q3 was a strong quarter given the shipments of -- for Frontier. We would expect, as we go into the fourth quarter, that it will be down sequentially quarter on quarter. But still, it's a strong growth year overall for a business that we think is a significant strategic growth driver for us over the next few years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So look, on the revenue side, when we look at the sequential growth, we have been able -- look, the supply chain, this is about really supply chain optimization. And we have been able to secure some additional supply, given some of the work that we've been doing. And we see strong demand across the board. But sequentially, what we're guiding to is stronger server demand, as well as gaming, and gaming includes the semi-custom game consoles, as well as our graphics business is doing quite well as well. And then in terms of the sequential margin, it's similar. I mean we're having servers, some improved mix and graphics driving upside. And that's partially offset by the consoles which are below corporate average. But net-net, I think it's a positive sequential both on revenue and margin.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

Sure, Joe. Look, the graphics business did have a strong third quarter. I think that's true for graphics gaming, as well as data center GPU. I think the portfolio that we have there with RDNA 2 has turned out really well. So we're pleased with how it's positioned competitively in the marketplace. And overall, gaming has been a secular trend that has continued with very strong demand. In terms of crypto, our view is that it's really negligible revenue for us in the third quarter. It's not a segment that we have been servicing. We've tried very much to try to keep our gaming graphics focused on gamers. And we were able to increase some of the supply for graphics, and that's one of the reasons that we saw the sequential growth that we saw. And going into the fourth quarter next year, again, I think we see gaming overall as a strong segment for us, and the product set is very good.

Thanks for taking the question. I have two quick questions, if I can as well. Just kind of sticking on the expectations in the next year, appreciating that you're not going to give a full guide. I'm just curious how we should think about the semi-custom business given how sizable that's been to the overall growth in 2021. Any framing of how you expect 2022 to shape up at this point?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,41,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Aaron. So, you know, again, if you look at the overall growth that we had in 2021, I would say it was actually quite balanced across all of our businesses. The semi-custom business was in the second year of ramp, and demand has exceeded supply. We've been able to ramp that as we've gone through the year. As we look into 2022, the historical view of game consoles has been year 4 is the peak, at least that's what it was in the last generation. What we expect in this generation is, again, very strong demand going into 2022. So we would expect it to grow into 2022, which would be the third year of the cycle, and then we'll see what happens after that. But overall, I think our view is we have a very balanced business with multiple growth drivers across data center, PCs, graphics, as well as consoles.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then the follow-up question is on your own supply chain side. I know in the prepared comments you said working on securing adequate supply given your growth trajectory. Are you currently able to meet on the goal of the demand that you currently see? And can you give any color of what -- how we should think about the supply situation on your end?,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,43,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, I mean, we've been working on ramping the supply chain really for more than a year. If you think about sort of dynamics here. What I'd like to say is, overall, the demand has been very, very high. So the fact that we can grow revenue this year 65% year on year, I think, is a testament to the supply chain work. I think if we had more supply, we could certainly ship more. That being the case, I think we're prioritizing in the most strategic segments. And we have invested significantly in capacity for additional capabilities, and we'll see some of that come online as we go through 2022. And we're going to continue to be aggressive to secure additional capacity because we believe our product portfolio will enable that growth.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,46,John Pitzer,Credit Suisse -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Good afternoon, guys. Congratulations, Lisa. Lisa, my first question is back on the supply side of things. I'm just wondering if you can help me better understand, was it more of an issue in your PC business or your server business? And I guess, especially as we look into next year, as supply begins to loosen up, this year, given how tight the overall ecosystem was, competing on price didn't make a lot of sense. As supply begins to accelerate across the ecosystem, how are you thinking about pricing, especially in lieu of your large competitor kind of resetting their gross margins for next year? In your view, does that give them more wiggle room? Or do you think that they're being pretty benign on the pricing side of things on that gross margin reset?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,47,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So maybe let me -- there's a lot of various aspects to that, John. So let me try to take it in pieces. As it relates to current supply, I want to make sure that we're clear. I mean we have brought on a tremendous amount of additional supply, and that's part of the reason that we overachieved the Q3 results and then we guided higher in Q4. So I do think that we have done a lot of work on our supply chain. In the PC market, in particular, I think the market is not necessarily constrained on CPUs, but more constrained on matched sets. And so we're trying to ensure that we're not building inventory in the channel. And that's part of the optimization that we do is to ensure that as we ship sell-in processors that we see matched sets to sell through. And so from that standpoint, we think inventory is very healthy at the OEMs, and that's an important factor as we go into 2022. As it relates to what happens with the pricing environment as supply eases up. I think, right now, what we see is a -- again, it's an environment where most people are prioritizing supply. As we go into 2022, though, I think this is all about the product. And what we view is -- our focus in sort of our product line has been moving up the stack, ensuring that we're providing significant value to our customers in terms of total cost of ownership on the server side and innovative features and capabilities on the PC side and the graphics side. And we're going to continue to do that. I mean we're excited about our product portfolio into 2022. We're going to continue to be very aggressive on the overall road map. And with that, I think our game plan is exactly what it was, what it always has been, which is lean into the product cycle, and the deep customer relationships and continue to build that out over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, Devinder, you did a good job kind of explaining the year-over-year changes in operating margins in the compute and graphics business. I'm wondering if you could talk a little bit about sequentially what happened. Revenue was up and op margins were down a little bit. Is that just the influence of the very strong growth in GPUs going into the data center? Because it sounds like in the core compute business mix probably got better sequentially for you. So I'm just trying to make sure I understand all the dynamics you play.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

Good evening. First question is about the supply constraints and how that affects seasonality as we go into the beginning of next year. And obviously, you're making efforts to bring on more supply. You spoke about in PC these constraints with regard to matched sets. I'm sure at this point, you don't want to provide guidance for Q1, but how should we be thinking about seasonality for Q1 as we contemplate these supply constraints?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

I mean I think -- let's see what would we say about seasonality. I don't have a lot to say other than typically, Q1 is down from Q4. That's typically what the pattern is, given the consumer-related businesses. It might be a little bit subseasonal as we go into this first quarter just given the demand environment, but we'll have to see how things play out over the next couple of months.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,53,Chris Caso,Raymond James -- Analyst,analyst,"-- All right. A little bit of a bigger picture question for my second question. And we've heard and seen from some of the hyperscalers is a trend of, in some cases, doing some custom designs, doing it on their own, often with ARM-based designs. Do you consider that an opportunity or a threat for AMD? And to what extent are you engaged with some of those hyperscalers on some of these custom designs because you do have an IP portfolio yourself?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,54,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Chris, on that, we definitely view it as an opportunity, right? So I think what's happening in the data center market is that as the need for compute gets larger, sort of this tailoring of compute for the various workloads is an important trend. I think our IP portfolio today is very strong. I think it will even be stronger given some of the things that we have in plan to allow more tailoring. And we are working very closely with a number of hyperscalers on sort of the vision of compute over the next few years and how we might put together some different solutions between our CPU, GPU, interconnect capability and then with the addition of Xilinx as well coming into our portfolio. So, lots of opportunity there for customization. I think that's a key trend that we're certainly going to lean into.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,57,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks. Let me ask a question echoed with a congrats of other people on the strong results. Lisa, I just wanted to ask about the comparison on your CNG side between the C and the G and specifically on the client graphic side of things. Clearly, this year has been a really strong year for AMD. Can you just talk about the go-forward on the client side in that? I think we're all pretty well aware of what's going to happen in the data center GPU side. But how do we reconcile your commentary on where you think the PC market would be in the flattish area versus the strength you've had in GPUs this year in a strong GPU market? Do you think that continues next year? How much of it is AMD specific? Or if the PC market is weaker, is that something that's a little bit of a headwind for AMD?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,58,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So again, what I would say is our market share is still, I would say, underrepresented, whether you're talking about the client sort of CPU or APU side or the GPU side. I think what we have seen here in the third quarter and then into the second half of the year is our graphics business has performed quite well. It is channel driven in the sense that there's still strong demand among gamers for GPUs. As we go into 2022, though, I don't view sort of the PC market as a headwind for the company. I think as we look at all of these markets, of course, we do a bunch of scenario planning if the market is up or if it's down. I think there are many who think that the market may be up. There are some who think that market may be down. And that's why we're choosing to model sort of the base case is flattish. But even within that market, whether you're talking about client CPUs or -- client GPUs, we think we have opportunities to gain share and grow in that business, just given the strength of our product portfolio and the fact that we are sort of underrepresented to we think the -- sort of what we can expect given those products.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 27, 2021","September 30, 2021.",1,59,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for that. And I guess as my follow-up, just one for Devinder on the opex side, and I'll give the same disclaimer that I know you're not going to give any specifics about next year, but you guys have done a great job of lowering your opex intensity throughout this year. I think you're going to be closer to 24% versus your 26% to 27% entering the year and 25% as of last quarter. So, great expansion there in margins and better leverage. As we look forward, though, I think the third quarter was the first time where you guys spent enough that it actually impacted a segment where the operating margin fell a little bit. And I think we all understand why you're doing that and it feeds great growth. So it's not a negative. But as I look into '22, do you think next year can be another year where your operating leverage is positive? Or do you expect to be able to spend closer to your former targets in kind of the 25% to 27% of sales range?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

Many of the things that Lisa talked about earlier is all about growth in many different vectors. And obviously, that requires funding from an opex standpoint, whether it's R&D, go-to-market, hiring, which we are doing from a viewpoint of the growth in the company. And I think from a modeling standpoint, a guidance standpoint, you can assume that the growth in opex will be lower in revenue. Margin continues to expand, opex flattish or even down. I mean you can model it, but very disciplined on that standpoint and making sure that we are investing for the growth is a top priority for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/10/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, yes, we continue to invest heavily in software, particularly on the data center GPU side. We -- with our next-generation GPU architecture, MI200, which we'll be talking a little bit about in the next few weeks, we have made significant investments in progress. Our focus has been on using sort of the Frontier beachhead with high-performance computing and expanding that into AI and working with our partners on that software development. So overall, continue to make good progress there. I think the Xilinx acquisition and bringing in sort of that software talent also provides opportunities to optimize across the overall portfolio in terms of just the software infrastructure that people want in an overall ecosystem.

And I guess just last question for me. So server share, if I look at your guidance for Q4, it looks like you're going to be in the 12.5% to 13% share, if I use the entire TAM, and that's up like 500 basis points versus last year Q4. So I guess the question is, like, is that a reasonable trajectory into next year? As if we're sitting to 12 months from now, would you be surprised if you gained another 500 basis points next year?

I think having a number of quarters where we're doubling the revenue year on year kind of speaks to the progress there. As we go into 2022, we still believe we are a share gainer in that environment just given the strength of our portfolio and let's call it, platforms that are still yet to launch across our customer set. So we're continuing to play out the strategy of a data center being a place where our technology is very differentiated.

Thank you so much for taking my questions, and congratulations on a very strong set of results. Lisa, you didn't really touch on the supply situation in the marketplace today. That appears to be a pretty big focus for companies and also for investors. How would you characterize the current gap between supply and demand? And importantly, as we look ahead to 2022, how comfortable are you from a foundry wafer capacity and ABS substrate capacity perspective as you continue to grow the business strong double digits? And then I've got a quick follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Well, thanks for the question. I think it's fair to say that the semiconductor demand environment and particularly the AMD demand environment has been very strong in 2021. We've been working on supply for the past couple of quarters. I think I'm actually quite pleased with the progress that we've made in terms of increasing our supply. And what I've said previously is, certainly, we do see some level of constraints, but we are making progress each quarter. And we made progress in the second quarter that enabled us to exceed the original guidance. And as we go into the second half of the year, we're continuing to bring on extra supply each quarter, which is leading to the full-year guidance raise that we have. So I think overall, we continue to make progress. I will say that it's tight, like you've heard from many other companies, through the end of this year. I think it improves in 2022. We've been planning for significant growth. Our model is one where we're going to drive significant growth. So we've been planning with that with our supply chain partners. And we do have confidence that we can continue to grow substantially as we go into the second half of this year and into 2022 with the supply chain.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,3,Toshiya Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. And then as a quick follow-up, I guess a multipart question on your server CPU business or data center business more broadly. I was hoping you could speak to sort of the revenue construct in the second quarter and if you can differentiate between second gen and third gen, Rome versus Milan, and then what you're seeing on the cloud side versus enterprise side of your business and the outlook into the second half as you think about sort of the different segments of that business. And then finally, you talked about data center being more than 20% of revenue in Q2, what's embedded in your second-half guidance? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. OK. Quite a few questions there. So let me try to work through them. So in terms of the makeup of our data center business, I mean our server business was very strong. I think the product capability and sort of just -- sort of the performance and the total cost of ownership for Milan has proven out very well with our customers. So we're very happy with that launch. In the second quarter, we did see significant growth with Milan. And that being the case, Rome was still a larger portion of the revenue. And I would say in the second quarter, it was more cloud-weighted. So we saw cloud tends to ramp faster on new generation, and that was the case in the second quarter. So cloud grew faster than enterprise. As we go into the second half of the year, we expect that Milan will ramp very quickly and cross over -- third gen will cross over second-generation in the third quarter. And what we're seeing actually is continued strength across cloud and HPC, which have been traditionally strong for AMD. But we're actually seeing very good momentum in enterprise. And I think with the breadth of the platforms that we have out there and just the coverage and then sort of the per core performance, as well as the overall socket level performance, we're getting a very strong traction, and we're pleased to see that. So I think as we go into the second half of the year, I think enterprise will be a stronger component for us than it was in the first half of the year, and that's the balance that we want. But overall, we're pleased with that. And then in terms of your question about server was -- I'm sorry, data center was greater than 20% of our revenue in the second quarter. We believe that the data center business will continue to be a strong driver for us into the second half of the year. And so it will be a larger percentage of our overall revenue in the second half of the year. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Aaron Rakers from Wells Fargo. Your line is now live.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,5,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. Congratulations as well in the quarter. I wanted to ask about kind of the trajectory of gross margin. If we take the full-year guidance now, guiding up 100 basis points with the 3Q guide into consideration, it looks like you're actually pushing toward a 50% gross margin. How do we think -- maybe you can unpack how we should think about the segment gross margin levels. And do you think that if we're hitting 50%, that's a new threshold that we can consider modeling going forward?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,6,Devinder Kumar,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer",company,"-- I think on the gross margin, first of all, I'll say we are very pleased with the progress we have made. And as you observed, we have taken up the guidance for the year from 47% to 48%. And in our long-term target model, we have plans to get to greater than 50%. And I think the strength of the businesses that Lisa just talked about, especially in the data center, help us get there. The product mix is important. The ramp in the data center and the client PC business as we gain revenue share is going to be important to drive that. And we are confident that we can continue to improve the gross margin given the mix of the business and also the revenue ramp in the businesses that are higher than corporate average gross margin. So I feel very good about getting to the greater than 50% over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,7,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Aaron, I was just going to add to that. I think the most important thing to think about as you think about our business going forward is it really is about the mix of business. So as data center becomes a higher percentage of our business, that's a favorable mix for us. And then within the segments as well, as we look at where we're strategically focusing as we really mix to the higher end of the portfolio, those are the key things that we're looking at from a margin standpoint. But there are always puts and takes in the business. It's just really about the mix.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,8,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yup. And then just as a real quick follow-up. As Milan ramps, and appreciating that Rome sounds like still the majority of the EPYC lineup, how successful have you been as far as leveraging a stronger position with regard to uplift on blended ASPs as we think about the continuation of Milan and even starting to think about Genoa going forward? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So as we think about sort of the trajectory of the business, it is about offering more performance per socket, and that is what we're doing. So I think Milan is certainly a performance uplift relative to Rome. It does lend itself to a higher ASP or a higher mix of the business. And then clearly, as we go to Genoa, we're going to continue that trajectory. So I think -- and then within server, there's also a mix between cloud and enterprise. As I said earlier, we're quite cloud weighted here in the first half of the year. And as we go to a stronger percentage of enterprise, that would also be a favorable mix in the service side of the business. Operator Thank you. Our next question is coming from Vivek Arya from Bank of America Securities.

Until last year, we saw AMD take about two to three points of server share annually. This year, the share gains seem to be accelerating on the order of four to five points. I'm curious, what's driving this acceleration? And did you see anything from Intel's road map disclosures yesterday that you think can impact your server share gain momentum?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Vivek, thanks for the question. Well, as you know very well, we're very focused on sort of multiquarter, multiyear progress in the server and the data center business. I think we're excited with the momentum around our server business. I think the product road map is very strong. I think the execution has been very strong. I think customers also, with the third generation in Milan, felt much more comfortable to go more broadly with Milan just because this was sort of the third time, right? They had -- many of our customers were on Rome already. But with Milan, it was sort of socket compatible, and so there was -- it was a faster time to ramp, and we're seeing it ramp faster. So we feel good about where we're positioned. I mean it's a very competitive market out there, Vivek. I'll always say that. We expect our competition to be really good, and we need to be better than that. And so our team is very focused on execution, and we're excited about Genoa. I think our customers are excited about Genoa. And so we need to keep the momentum and keep the road map execution as strong as it has been.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon, everybody. I guess, Lisa, one of the things I was really pleased to see in this set of results and investors have asked me about quite a bit is that you're delivering the revenue upside but the operating margin leverage is coming with that. You guys have rightly been spending a ton to grow the business, and that's been reflected in the growth. And I just wonder how you're thinking about the balance of revenue growth versus delivering sort of upside to operating margins going forward because it's an item that's been a fulcrum from some investors in my conversation. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,15,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Matt. Maybe I'll start and then see if Devinder has anything to add. I think we've always been very thoughtful about how we both invest in the business, as well as delivering operating leverage. And look, I think our revenue growth has been very strong. It was certainly above what we had previously forecasted. We are taking the opportunity to invest in the business, and that's investing in R&D and investing in sales and marketing and really the overall capabilities there. But you do see the operating leverage in the business. And I think we intend to continue to deliver improved operating margins as we go forward. So I think we can do it -- do all of those things. I think we can continue to grow revenue significantly above the industry. We will continue to invest in opex at a lower rate than the revenue growth. And we will continue to deliver operating margin improvement over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

I think you covered it, Lisa. I think that's well said. I mean as you saw, we did update the guidance for opex as a percentage of revenue from about 26% to 25% for the year, and we continue to be disciplined from a viewpoint of the investments we need to make to grow the business, as well as obviously invest in R&D, go-to-market.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,17,Matth Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you both for that. As my follow-up, it's interesting, the more strength the PC market shows, it's almost like the more concern investors have that eventually we revert back toward the mean. And Lisa, your competitor gave some fairly bullish commentary about the state of the PC industry going forward. And I wonder if you might share your view. And we've heard in our work a few bobbles in the Chromebook market and maybe a couple of PC OEMs saying they're building a tiny bit of CPU inventory. So on the back of that commentary about the market, if you have any views on your own visibility in inventory of AMD parts or maybe the gap between orders and your ability to fulfill them in the PC market, those things would be really helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,18,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Matt. So look, there are lots of different signals in the PC market. So maybe I will make a few comments. I think it's fair to say that the end-user demand has been very strong. So very strong in the first half of the year, very strong in the second half of last year. And that's from all this work from home, school from home, sort of, and then some of this return-to-office trends. Within that, there is a little bit of a mix shift as you go through time. When I look at the market, I would say that we've performed very well. Within this market backdrop, we continue to gain revenue share. And what that means is we're focusing on the most strategic segments of the PC market. As we go forward, I do agree that end-user demand is strong. I also believe that if you look at the second half of this year for the PC market, you'll hear about sort of pockets of component shortages or match sets and things like that. So we're taking that into account as we think about the second half of the year. From our perspective, we're planning the PC -- our PC business to be about flattish first half into second half. And again, we think that that's very well supported by all of the ordering patterns and all of our sort of look at what the PC OEMs are doing. From an inventory standpoint, we do not believe there is significant inventory. We do track it very closely, of AMD product anyways. We look at it at the retailers, as well as at -- with our OEMs. So I think we have this very -- we're watching it very closely and recognize that the PC market may go up or down. We're expecting it to be -- like I said, for our business roughly flattish first half into second half. And that being the case, we continue to believe that there is strong end user demand and there's just some supply matching that needs to happen in the marketplace. Operator Thank you.

Thanks for letting me ask a question. Congratulations on the solid results. First is just a clarification. I think you said in your prepared comments relative to the June quarter that EPYC grew solidly double digits sequentially. The overall segment grew about 19%. I'm just curious, did EPYC outgrow the overall segment? Or was it more in line? Can you give us a sense of how it did relative to the segment?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then my second question is just more of a strategic question around pricing. Clearly, last week, on their conference call, Intel talked about perhaps being a little bit more price aggressive, especially in data center, to protect share. And I'd like to get kind of your thought on pricing. I mean in my mind, that market is much more about a total cost of ownership than an entry point. And given your price performance, I'm just kind of curious as to how concerned you are about the pricing environment and how concerned you think we should be over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for that, John. Look, I think the market has always been competitive. I don't see that it has become more competitive or that's changed. As you said, pricing is not the first order variable when you're buying a server CPU. It really is about total cost of ownership. I think the performance leadership that we have is clearly there, and I think customers see that. So we'll always fight for every socket. I mean you know that we're very competitive in that fashion. But we think that the way to do that is with the strength of the road map and the strength of the deep partnerships. And price is sort of a second order lever in this market.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

Now with Milan on a strong ramp trajectory and also good to see the momentum in enterprise, as you guys continue to drive EPYC into new markets, just wanted to get an update on the pull in the telco service provider market, right? It's a relatively big market, right? It's about a $6 billion, $7 billion market. Milan supports much more networking functionality versus prior generations. And operators continue to virtualize the core of their networks. And with 5G, they're also starting to virtualize their radio access networks.

Harlan, thanks for the question. Yes. Look, we believe the telco segment is a very good segment for us. And I would say that there is a lot of interest. I wouldn't say it's a significant piece of revenue today. So I view that as sort of opportunity as we continue to build out the solutions for Milan. But it is one of the areas that we believe is very strategic for AMD. And as Xilinx comes into -- so as we combine the Xilinx business with ours, I think their relationships as well in the communications and telco market will be helpful in just bringing the overall solution set together. So yes, we think it's a good market for us, but I would say we're still very early on that particular cycle.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then on the strong early momentum in enterprise as you move into the second half and as you probably have some visibility into next year because the enterprise call cycles are probably a bit longer than some of your cloud customers, can you just talk about the breadth of the engagements in enterprise across large corporations and small- to medium-sized businesses?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,27,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Harlan. So we have seen a very strong pipeline. And that started with Rome, but we see that expanding with Milan. I think if you look at the breadth of platform offerings from all the largest OEMs for Milan, it's just broader than our past generation. And I think people are also starting to come up with more appliances, and we've done quite a bit more ISV optimization as well. So our visibility is very good into the second half of the year, and it's also very good into 2022. I think the good piece about this, as you said, it is longer design cycles. But with large companies and certainly with some of the Tier 2 cloud guys, we've seen good strong visibility for multiple quarters. And then as we think about sort of the small, medium business and more of the channel business, I think all of that is a strong opportunity for us. Operator Thank you.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,31,Stacy Rasgon,Sanford C. Bernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, around the PC environment, so you sound a bit more sanguine about it versus your competitor who does seem to be calling for growth next year. And maybe that's a function of some of the opportunities -- the other opportunities that you have. I'm just curious, given your other outlook for kind of continued strong growth, do you think that strong growth is dependent at all on the state of the PC market next year? So for example, like if PCs, say, were down 10% next year, do you still think you could still grow strongly year over year in 2022 off the rest of the portfolio?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure, Stacy. So look, I think -- I mean there are lots of different signals in the PC market for 2022. So I think what we're doing is taking, let's call it -- we're planning for various different scenarios. But I would say that from our point of view, the overall answer to your question is yes. I mean we believe that there is a -- we have strong growth momentum across the portfolio. And we believe that we will -- we can grow in the PC business as well even if the market is, let's call it, not as robust as some might forecast. Our view is that we're still underrepresented across the board in the markets that we play in, whether you're talking about data center or PCs or gaming. And on the PC side, in particular, we're making very good progress in sort of commercial, premium gaming notebooks, premium consumer. We have more platforms coming with our Ryzen 5000 and our next generation. So I think our sort of outlook is less dependent on what exactly happens in the market. But obviously, we watch the market very closely, and we work with our OEM partners very closely to stay in tune with what they're seeing.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

That's helpful. For my follow-up, I want to ask the opex question a little more explicitly. So you didn't take it down for the year and you're 25%. But if I'm doing my math right, the Q4 opex percentage is closer to 28%. And I get why and I understand. But I think the Analyst Day model you've given, 16 months ago, had sort of an opex to revenue midpoint somewhere in the mid-26s. Should we think about opex, I guess, trending down from that exit rate to that more kind of like model level? Or are you still going to be taking this opportunity, at least for the next like several quarters, maybe to invest at a bit of a higher level? Is that exit rate of opex to revenue more representative of what we might see in the near to medium term?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

I think, Stacy, first of all, you hit it right. The priority for this is to invest in the business for growth. We are growing significantly and just took up the guidance. So obviously, there's a lot of areas to invest in to support that growth, whether it's R&D or go-to-market or even hiring. Second half of the year, you also have salary increases that kick in for our employees. And obviously, that does drive the opex higher just given the guide we gave for Q3, which is higher than Q2 from an overall opex standpoint. As far as the numbers are concerned, I know you're probably running your model there, but those numbers are approximate. And really, if you ask me from an overall standpoint, I would expect that for the year, we come in a little under 25%. We gave the approximate guidance of 25%, but I think we'll come in under 25% for the year. Nothing extraordinary there. It's just making sure we plan the business, support the growth and make sure that into 2022, as we have new product introductions that Lisa just talked about, we continue to support that because there are a lot of new products coming into 2022. So really, that's what it is, Stacy.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for letting me ask questions. I just want to ask on the graphics strength. I think you said it doubled. Just curious, is there a way to parse out how much is coming from crypto? And then I think what I heard you say is in the back half, it's a driver for September. Just driving into December with PC flat again kind of just maybe you could describe how much of the strength in graphics is kind of more client graphics versus the data center?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,38,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Blayne. So to your question about the quarter, the second quarter, we do not believe there was a significant crypto component in our graphics revenue. I mean the graphics revenue, as we see it, is really RDNA 2 ramping. We launched some new products in mobile. And we're pleased with the reception of RDNA 2 in mobile, as well as we started shipments of some of our data center GPUs. So our view is that the crypto-based component is really negligible. And then as we go into the second half of the year, I wouldn't say graphics is the largest driver of our business. The driver really is around data center, and that's data center across CPUs, as well as some of the early ramp of the GPUs. But we do expect there continues to be strong demand for gaming graphics. And we know there are a lot of gamers out there who are still looking to get some of their cards, and so we will support that demand. But I don't think crypto was a big piece of it, and we'll continue to focus our efforts on getting our gaming graphics over into the gamers' hands.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then maybe just a follow-up on the data center GPU opportunity. You mentioned you have some new wins with HPC and a couple of them are fairly chunky. Just kind of curious when to think about that impacting the model. Is that a next year story? Or is it a bit further out?,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,40,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So I mean we'll see some growth in the second half of the year off of a small base. I think it becomes a more meaningful driver as we go into next year and then certainly the following year. So think about the data center GPU story as sort of the early innings of what we did on the CPU side. We're excited about the product, Blayne. I think it's a very exciting product with our next-generation CDNA 2. I think we have won some early wins with HPC. We're continuing to work with some cloud customers, the machine learning and AI aspects of it. But it's really a multiyear journey, and the larger driver of our data center business is the server CPU side. Operator Thank you. Our final question today is coming from Mark Lipacis from Jefferies.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,41,Mark Lipacis,Jefferies -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions. Lisa, I had a question about your announcement with Google for their Tau instances. I thought it was fascinating because it looks like they're disabling one of the threads and running Milan in a single-threaded mode, which seems to me like a throwback to 20 years ago. So I had a couple of questions on this. I haven't seen Intel Xeon processors in this mode. Is there something about the AMD architecture or the Milan architecture beyond higher core count that just makes it more sense to use AMD processors in this mode versus Intel processors? Are you seeing a lot of demand outside of Google for this kind of single-threaded implementation? And if you are, would it make sense to make like a separate line of CPUs that streamlines the logic for only one processing thread and then you could fit -- potentially fit a lot more cores on the CPU and cut the power dissipation? It seems like it would be the next logical step. Would that even be feasible? Is that something you consider you're getting demand for? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 27, 2021","June 30, 2021.",1,42,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Mark, the way I would say it is this, and again, I want to be a little bit sort of broad in how I answer the question. I think what you see in the server land is that there are lots of different use cases for the processors. And you have some that are looking for sort of the bleeding-edge performance. And there, the multi-threading is very, very useful. And you get better performance per watt, performance per dollar and just overall socket-level performance. I think what we've seen is that as you look across use cases, there are some use cases where you're more focused on performance per dollar than overall performance. And you might choose to optimize sort of what you do, sort of how you configure the processor differently. I think what you'll see from us, Mark, is we're spending a lot of time with our hyperscale partners. And what we want to do is offer them the type of incidence that they need and that their customers need. So you'll see us do more customization across the board with the idea of we want to satisfy that range of performance that -- across sort of the entire range of use cases. So I think we'll talk more about how we think about the road map as we go forward. But I will say that we're being very thoughtful in ensuring that we have the right product for the right workload and that it's optimized for performance and power and cost in all those areas.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/07/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2021-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, you're guiding -- you're increasing the full-year guidance by almost $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion. Could you give us some sense of what has changed in the last three months? Because your competitor was recently talking about cloud digestion, and you're raising guidance by $1.3 billion. So I'm curious what changed in the last three months? And if you could help us parse which products or end markets are contributing to this increase, how much from servers or PC or semi-customer, or if there is any crypto impact. So any color on what's driving this really strong guidance and increase for the year would be very helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So we are -- we started the year very strong, very pleased with the first-quarter performance and what we see overall for the year. So we are increasing our full-year guidance. We exceeded in the first quarter. We guided up in the second quarter, and then that's carrying through to the second half of the year. What we've seen is the following. We came into the year with an overall strong demand picture, and that was certainly true. What we've seen over the last 90 days is consistent strong demand, very strong visibility from our customers on what they need throughout the year. Particularly, you asked about data center. I think we saw actually strong signals in the first quarter that it would be a strong data center year for us. We're on a product ramp cycle. We launched new products in PCs on the mobile side with our Ryzen 5000. We launched new products on the graphics side with Radeon 6000. And then the launch of the third-generation Milan has actually gone very, very well. So in terms of what we see, we see very strong demand for our products. We see good customer ordering patterns and strong backlog. And then we have also seen that the supply chain has been tight overall for the semiconductor industry. And we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. And so we also have good visibility to additional supply as we go throughout the year. So with all that in place, I would say we feel very good about how the year is shaping up. In terms of where you see the strength overall, I would say it's strength across all businesses. But particularly the strength in data center is good. And we also see just, again, very good visibility and very close working relationships with our customers. You asked about crypto. We do not -- we have negligible crypto in here. So this is really the foundational business, really, the new products and just seeing the customers adopt and ramp quickly.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Very helpful. And, Lisa, for my follow-up, should we assume that now you are getting adequate supply? So you're kind of caught up from a supply perspective and supply is no longer a constraint. Or is that still a constraint? And if it is, in which end market? Because you're keeping full-year gross margins steady at 47%. So I was curious if there is any impact from supply or rising input costs that could be impacting your gross margins, which you decided to keep to kind of flat versus your last outlook?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I would say, Vivek, it's still early in the year. So the entire semiconductor supply chain is very, very tight. I think you hear that from all of our peers in the marketplace. That being said, we've been working very closely with our supply chain partners. We have seen improvements that have led to the improved full-year guide. We're going to continue to work on that because right now, I would say the channel -- the inventories are very low throughout the entire supply chain, whether you talk about at our customers or in the channels. And so there's quite more that we would like to be able to do. That being the case, I think we continue to work well with our partners and take lots of actions there. As it relates to overall costs and things like that, we are watching those things, I think, from logistics and some of the component costs and things like that. So there's -- mostly the gross margin guidance is reflective of the fact that we do have ramping of our new products. And we also have some ramp of the gaming products, which are a little bit below corporate average. But we'll see how things progress as we go throughout the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Nice results. Maybe just following up on Vivek's question. I was just curious. The semi-custom business obviously is not following any sort of seasonality, but there's a lot of talk about supply constraints there as well.

So thanks, Blayne, for the question. I think the semi-custom business, if you look at the console launches that happened last year, I mean, they were phenomenally good launches, right, very, very good products. So you're right, seasonality is completely different this year than sort of a typical year. We had a strong first quarter better than seasonal. We were down but down single digits. There's a bit of growth as we go through the year, but it's just starting from such a high point in the first half of the year. So the way I would say it is I think there is a strong secular demand for gaming. And whether you're talking about consoles or you're talking about PC gaming or you're talking about the overall sort of gaming ecosystem, there's a significant demand. And so we believe there's strong demand, and we're continuing to ramp supply to meet that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, Blayne, I think the PC business has certainly had a very strong second half of last year and is strong this year. I think within that, we feel very good about our progress, particularly in notebooks and particularly in the premium segments of notebooks. So we had a strong record quarter for our notebook business. Our ASPs were up sequentially and year over year. I think we're seeing traction in sort of the premium ultrathin, gaming, and commercial. We feel very good about the platforms that we have and the platforms that we have throughout the year. Ryzen 5000 is a very competitive product. I will say that there are lots -- a bit of low-end units have come into the market, but our focus on the premium segments have done very well.

I wanted to ask a little bit about the server CPU cycle. I know you've talked about kind of an expanding footprint with the cloud guys. But I'm curious of where we stand today as far as more of the traditional OEMs, the progression of their systems. I think you've said 100-plus systems. When do you think that those will all be shipping in the market? And how would you put the context of Milan relative to Rome on that front? And I have a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,13,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So, Aaron, the data center business obviously is a very strategic focus for us. And with EPYC with each generation, we've really tried to expand the reach. I think here in the first quarter, what we saw is very strong results, doubling year over year. It is on the strength of cloud. But what we saw was both Rome ramping, so we saw Rome units up sequentially, and we also saw Milan ramping. And what that says, this is what we expected. We actually expected that we had a good footprint in Rome and that that would continue to be well deployed as we come into the first half of this year, and that's played out. And then Milan is just a very, very good product. I mean, it's extremely well-positioned. Not only do we have per socket leadership, but we have per core leadership, which, again, expands the footprint. So in terms of your question about cloud versus enterprise, we were more cloud-weighted in the first quarter as some of those instances, both internal and external, ramped. We would expect that enterprise, both enterprise, as well as HPC deployments, will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. But we'll see Rome and Milan in the market together all through this year, and we expect strong adoption on the enterprise side.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then the other question kind of dovetailing off that is you talked in response to a couple of different questions. You've talked about visibility. Our visibility is very strong. It's improved, etc. So how would you characterize your visibility today relative to, let's say, what it was three months ago? And what gives you the confidence? Has there been something that's happened as far as discussions with the cloud guys that's given you more confidence in the visibility of the growth through the remainder of this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, Aaron, I mean, when we started this year, we expected to have a strong product cycle, just given everything that we saw in terms of platforms, design wins, sort of customer engagements, and process. But in the last 90 days, I think we've seen that really firm up. So from the standpoint of just the consistency in all of the schedules that were supposed to be met, I think customers are liking what they see. We are having multi-quarter conversations, just given the tightness overall in the supply chain. I think everyone is wanting to be clearer and more transparent about their needs. And that's very helpful for us, frankly. That's very helpful for us in a tight environment. It gives us the ability to plan several quarters out. And so I think that's the differences is we have strong visibility into what customers want and what we can deliver. And so that gives us confidence that we have the right signals in place.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to ask a question about the enterprise notebook business. And I noticed you highlighted in the release and in the slides where you are in several different verticals in design wins on enterprise notebook in the Fortune 500. And I wonder if you might speak a little bit about the relationships that you're building with the big enterprise customers. Do you have FAE support, software support, firmware support, etc.? Do you have the right people in place to really ramp that business more materially going forward? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,18,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, definitely, Matt. It's been a high focus for us to ramp our enterprise notebook business, as well as the enterprise server business. And they actually share many of the same customers and IT departments. And so yes, we've made very good progress on the enterprise notebook business. I think we have a great set of platforms with our OEM partners. We've also ramped up our field application support and our customer-engagement models for deployment. Overall, I think we've gotten some very nice commercial notebook design wins. And again in this environment, for us, the important thing is to stay very focused on the longevity of the business that we win. And so a lot of focus is on those commercial pipelines and how they develop both on the notebook side, as well as on the server side. And I think we've made good progress, but we still have a lot of opportunity to grow as we go through the coming quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

For my follow-up, it's a bit unrelated. One of the businesses that maybe you've not had supply or there's been other parts of the business growing much more quickly, I wanted to ask a bit about gaming. The new RDNA 2 architecture, I think, brings some new features, but obviously, there's a strong incumbent competitor in the gaming market. Maybe you could just talk about where you are competitively right now, how you see supply coming online that might support that gaming franchise a bit better, and just maybe the lay of the land and gaming right now. Because it's one piece of the business that everything else is going so well, I think there are some opportunities there.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,20,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So the consumer graphics or the gaming graphics business, as you talked about, has actually done well for us. It grew double digits this past quarter. We had a very deliberate strategy here with the launch of RDNA 2. We started at the top of the stack with our Big Navi product. And then we've now introduced a couple of additional products. And you'll see that both from the channel, sort of adding board cards into more OEM systems and notebook business as well as additional variants. So it's an important market segment for us. We're happy with the progress. I think gamers really appreciate the product. It's fair to say that the graphics demand is very high across the marketplace. So we've actually put quite a bit of product into the market, but the demand still exceeds supply. You'll see that increase as we go through the second half of the year. And overall, I think the progress that we've made with RDNA 2 is fantastic, and we continue to believe that gaming overall is a great secular growth story.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the data center GPU business. I realize it's still a relatively small percentage of the overall business.

Thanks for the question. We're making very nice progress in the data center GPU business. It's in the investment mode now, so we're investing heavily in the business. We launched the CDNA architecture or the compute-optimized architecture last year. You'll see updates to that this year as we bring out the next generation with our Frontier systems. The revenue is albeit on the lower side in terms of just size of the business relative to the rest of the business, but we will see growth into the second half of the year. And the business here is actually very strategic, right? It's the idea of really putting together heterogeneous systems and bringing our CPU technology with EPYC together with our GPU technology with Instinct with the software capabilities that we have been investing in, and really getting strong HPC systems, as well as AI and machine learning capabilities. So we will see growth in the second half this year. It will still be a smaller business, but we see it growing in this strategic time frame over the next couple of years. And it is very much that end-to-end story of what you need to really satisfy sort of the key workloads in the data center.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then as my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the potential threat from ARM longer term. Within x86, obviously, you've got significant runway from a market share perspective. But how are you thinking about the potential threat from ARM-based processors, both in your client business, as well as your server business? You've got Apple obviously internalizing some of their CPUs on the client side, hyper-scalers talking about internal solutions. And your closest GPU competitor launched -- or introduced rather ARM-based CPU multiple years out. So any thoughts on ARM versus x86 and how you address that would be helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,26,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, so absolutely. I think the key point here is you really have to have a very, very strong product road map, and that is really what we're focused on. I think the overarching trend that computing is becoming very important and so there are additional entrants trying to address different aspects of computing, I think is to be expected. And when you look at the data center, in particular, I think the trend that computing is becoming more workload-optimized is also an important trend. These are the things that we've been thinking about for a long time, and we've been looking at ensuring that we address that in our road map. So our focus is to continue to optimize solutions across the data center and across the PC ecosystem, make sure that what we have is very competitive, addressing what customers' needs are. And we also have the ability to customize solutions as well with our strong IP portfolio. So all that being the case, I think the answer is very competitive market, but we feel very good about the road map that we have in front of us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Congratulations on the solid result. Lisa, maybe another way to ask that last question of x86 versus ARM. I'm wondering if you could address it from the perspective of general-purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC? Because clearly as Moore's Law is coming up with some issues, the move toward semi-custom and ASIC is much more prevalent. I know to the answer to Toshiya's question, you said that you're doing -- or you have the ability to do semi-custom. Do you actually have engagements? And how do you see sort of general-purpose compute versus semi-custom and ASIC playing out over time?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,30,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, John, the way I would address that is I think there's a whole range of computing solutions that you need. And this is back to a few years ago, our conversations about heterogeneous compute being you need to have the right compute for the right workload. So I think that's the overarching aspect of it. No question that for our business, general-purpose compute is the largest piece of our business and will continue to be so. We are doing -- we certainly do optimizations for specific customers today. And I think that's -- that for large cloud customers, they expect that, and we are doing that. We do have the ability to optimize on a more specific basis. And if you look at the evolution of our architecture, I think that when we do these chiplet architectures and things like that, it really allows that. So lots of good engagements going on with customers overall, and I think the key is to be able to have the right IP building blocks. And that's what we're focused on, right, having the best CPU cores, the best GPU capability, having great interconnect. And then with the bringing on of Xilinx having the adaptive computing solutions there as well, it gives us a lot of options to optimize solutions with customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

And, Lisa, as my follow-up, you're still relatively early in this new gaming console cycle. And typically, through those cycles, your products gross margins had some pretty good uplift. I'm wondering if you can just help characterize where you think you are in sort of the gross margin cycle for the gaming console business?

Thanks for taking my question. Lisa, I guess you had indicated you believe -- I believe you said you thought you gained share in the server market. My back of the envelope calculation suggests you gained at least 2 points of share in service, which is an acceleration on my estimate of about 1% share gain a quarter over the previous four quarters. So I guess can you tell me if my math is materially off? And if not, is this a new higher rate of share gains? And what would you chop this up to? Are you guys at a tipping point? Are your customers at a tipping point for embracing AMD as a supplier? Do they have increased comfort? Or is your ecosystem for support? Can you just maybe just give us a higher-level picture about where you think your customers are and really embracing and ramping up your server offerings at a higher rate.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,35,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So in terms of our data center performance in the first quarter, it was quite strong. And when I look at the drivers of that, we saw cloud, in particular, quite strong. And when I look at the drivers underneath that, there are a couple of things that have come together. First of all, I mean, we've been very, very deeply engaged with our customers the last number of quarters in qualifying new instances, qualifying new internal workloads, really expanding the regional capability of our coverage. And so all of those things, I think, have left -- led to some lift overall in the data center business. And then going forward, I think the other piece of it is if you recall when we did the Naples to Rome transition, that transition was pretty much people switched from Naples to Rome. What we're seeing in this cycle is a bit different. What we're seeing is that Rome has a set of very strong coverage in terms of applications that they're in, that are ramping very nicely, that are having good demand. And then on top of that, we're adding Milan, which is just a very strong product on top of that. So I think those are some of the things that are perhaps a bit different about what we're seeing right now. That being this case, things move around from quarter to quarter. So I would say that the data center signals that we're seeing are positive. We're excited about what we're seeing. It's a lot of engagements with customers. And the main thing for us is as important as the current year is we're also very focused on the long-term road map. And so we're engagement -- we're engaging now on Zen 4 and beyond. So it really is a multigenerational discussion with our top customers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

And then a follow-up on -- just coming back to ARM. You -- they -- you answered the previous questions with kind of talking about embracing the idea of having heterogeneous architectures in semi-custom and working with your customers to develop solutions. But if I go back, AMD had an ARM server offering before. Can you give us an update on the state of that ARM server IP? Is that something that you can resurrect? Or have you've been keeping it, the development working on that? And can you discuss -- are your customers asking for your help in delivering semi-custom solutions that have an ARM component to it? Because from what I can tell, it looks like three cloud service providers have ARM server offerings in their platform, but there's a lot that don't and don't have quite the development capabilities. So I was hoping if you could just talk more specifically about the IP that you had. And are you bringing that back if your customers are asking for it? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So, look, we know the ARM architecture well. Certainly, our engineers know it well. And we consider ARM a partner in many respects. We use ARM IP in various aspects of our devices. In terms of that specific custom ARM design, we don't have that in plans right now. In terms of whether we would do custom ARM designs, I think the answer is yes. That's the whole idea of the semi-custom business. And so I think it's less about ARM versus x86 and much more about having the right IP in the right sort of combination to satisfy sort of the customer solutions. And that's the way we look at it. It's really -- what problem are you trying to solve? And let's look at sort of the collection of IP that we have and the capabilities that we have to help address that set of sort of issues.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I wanted to ask you a little bit of a conceptual question. In your full-year guidance, you clearly raised the revenues to a very strong number, but you kept the margins the same. I think people understand the operating margin side of it, that you have an opportunity to invest and great opportunities in front of you to grow. But on the gross margin side of things, I'm just a little surprised, given the strength that you're talking about in the data center business, the HPC, Frontier, those things kicking in the back half of the year. I'm a little surprised that it didn't go up. Now you've delivered very consistent guidance and increases improvements over time, and I can't recall the last time you missed your gross margin guidance. But I'm just wondering what the puts and takes are that would keep that gross margin guidance flat for the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So let me perhaps start, and then Devinder may have a few comments. So I think from an overall revenue standpoint, I think we are very comfortable with the guide up, just given the visibility that we have on the customer demand front and on the supply front. On the overall margins, we are guiding up sequentially as we go from Q1 to Q2. And then I think for the second half of the year, what we would say is, look, it's early in the year. And it's a very dynamic environment, Ross, I mean, a very dynamic environment. And so we're watching the puts and takes, and there's always product mix things that come into play in terms of the puts and takes. But I think we're confident that we're in a good place. And as we go through the year, we'll give you more updates on that. But there isn't anything more than that. I think it's just where we are in the year. And given the dynamic environment we have in the marketplace, that's what gives us approximately the 47% guide. I don't know, Devinder, you want to add to that?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

That's really helpful. For my follow-up, I want to be a little more tactical, but it will somewhat fold into your answer to the first question. And that is for your second-quarter guide from the midpoint of up roughly 4%, could you give us a little bit of puts and takes between your two main segments? And I guess the slightly longer-term question part of that would be data center being high teens in the first quarter was great sequential growth, doubling year over year.

So in terms of the second quarter, as we look at sequential growth, we do see sequential growth in the data center business, so on the server side, as well as on the data center graphics side, as well as some growth on the gaming side. As we look at the full year, our expectation is that the percentage of the company that is sort of the data center percentage of the company will increase as we go through the next couple of quarters. And that's just the dynamic of some of the strength in the consumer businesses in the first half, so that's not normal seasonality. And just the acceleration or some of the growth that we see in the data center business as we go throughout the year would lead to a higher percentage of revenue in data center on higher revenue.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

I first had a question on data center in the quarter. So the EESC was up almost $100 million. EPYC was up, and semi-custom was down, which means EPYC was up even more than that. I know it was both Rome and Milan grew. But how much of the actual growth, the $100 million-plus sequentially that must have been EPYC, how much of that growth, how did that split out between Rome and Milan? Was it like the majority of the growth of that was Milan? And how do you see Milan as a percentage of a data center CPU mix in Q2?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,47,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Stacy. So if I look at the first quarter, we shipped Milan as well in the fourth quarter, right? So we shipped a good amount of Milan in the fourth quarter, a good amount in the first quarter. I would say in terms of growth, it was probably more Rome-weighted in the first quarter compared to Milan, but there was good growth in both. And then as we go into the second quarter, we would still expect to see growth in both Rome and Milan, with Milan growing faster as that ramps. And we would expect by the third quarter that it would cross over, and Milan would perhaps be higher than Rome. Now, obviously, these things change a little bit as customers go through their ramps, but that's sort of what we see. So the meta point is Rome demand is robust and will stay a good part of the revenue for this year in its entirety. And then Milan is ramping quickly, and customer adoption is strong. And so we expect it will ramp quickly as we go through the next couple of quarters. Hopefully, that answers your question.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

I have a follow-up if you don't mind. I actually do want to ask a question about opex. So I know the model you gave at the analyst day had a midpoint for opex revenue of 26.5%. I know you're running ahead of revenue and everything right now. But if I sort of back out the second-half implied guidance for opex, it actually is at that 26.5% run rate in the second half to get to 26% for the full year. Should we think about, I guess, it's like as we go into 2022, do you think you're sort of at the model opex run rate, that sort of like more than 26%, 26.5% on whatever the revenue is? Is that the right way to think about the opex trajectory going forward? And I guess like -- do you think you're actually spending enough at this point, given where you're taking the road map? Are you spending at the right levels right now to ensure that that road map is actually cemented and firm?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

I think we are -- the revenue is well above our long-term model. And certainly, in this year, it's well above our long-term model. Last year, it was well above our long-term model. And we're taking the opportunity to invest. And from that standpoint, our investments in R&D really, as you say, cementing the road map, our investments across sales and field support, and all of the customer-facing support. And frankly, we're making investments in sort of some of the infrastructure surrounding the company as well since it's just a much larger company than it was a few years ago. So I think the answer is yes. We're investing enough. And I think we're taking the opportunity to be very aggressive with those investments to -- given the strength of the revenue growth.

Lisa, I wanted to ask also about share gains. You've done a great job this year in both client and in data center. At the same time as was referenced before, Intel's tone is definitely changing. They use the word leveraging relationships. And they talked about other tactics to sort of stem or arrest some of the share losses and they're now offering x86 cores via foundry and things like that. So I guess the question is sort of beyond this year because the competitive environment this year is pretty much set. So do you think we can extrapolate the success you've had this year into '22 and '23? Or do you think the competitive environment will intensify in the next few years?

So there's -- by the way, there are lots of competitors out there. From our standpoint, I think over the past few years and the past few generations, I think we've built a track record with customers, and we've built a set of deep relationships. And we've learned a ton about what's important to customers, where to spend the time, the effort, and where we need a close partnership. So I feel very good about where we're positioned this year, but I feel very excited about what we have in the road map going forward. And I mean, we are not slowing down.

You talked a little bit about the supply constraints that you've been dealing with. Can you talk about where those are coming from? Is that a wafer constraint, substrate constraint, both, or other stuff? And when you talk about making progress and kind of getting more supply out, what's the source of that progress?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 27, 2021","March 31, 2021.",1,59,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, you know, I think, Joe, I would say overall the demand if we look at coming into this year, the demand has been sort of higher than our expectations. And there are sort of industrywide types of things that are going on. We work very closely with our supply chain partners. So whether it's wafers or back-end assembly test capacity or substrate capacity, and we work it on a product line by product line level. So I don't know that there is a single thing that I would point out. I would say that on a product line level, what we've done and what we'll continue to do is ensure that there are multiple sources for things, particularly in the back end, that gives us flexibility to move things back and forth. We continue -- on the substrate side, in particular, I think there has been under-investment in the industry. And so we've taken the opportunity to invest in some substrate capacity dedicated to AMD, and that will be something that we continue to do going forward. We're also -- I mean, we also have fantastic engineering teams that are just looking at how we, together in the ecosystem, just get more productivity into the system. And we work very closely with TSMC to make sure that we're forecasting well and getting the right support. So I think it's all of the above in terms of making sure that we have the capabilities. And the other thing I'll mention, Joe, is just it's not just about processors, but it's included -- it's also ensuring that they're matched sets in the ecosystem. And so our teams are also working very closely with our OEMs to make sure that we're together ensuring that they're the full system components necessary. So it is a complex supply chain environment. And I will tell you, given everything that I've seen, it is a complex environment because all markets are so hot. But I'm happy that we've been able to make progress. And by the way, we're not done, right? There's plenty more that we would like to do to get more capability in the supply environment. And so we're working closely with our partners across the board.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/04/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2021-earnings-call-t/

So thanks for the question, Blayne. Look, we're excited going into 2021. Obviously, 2020 was quite a strong growth year for us. As we look at the annual guidance, we really do see strength across all of our businesses. So the -- the -- it's led by our larger businesses. So significant growth. We expect significant growth in server, growth in PCs, as well as growth in the semi-customer console business. But we also see growth in our graphics business across consumer and data center graphics as we ramp the full product lines there as we go through 2021. So overall, I think we're seeing the strength of the new product portfolio, as well as a positive demand environment.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And -- and then maybe as a follow-up. I'm curious about how you think about the shape of the year. Obviously, March seems to be bet -- much better than seasonal across several product lines. And I'm just curious how you're thinking about the overall PC market? I think Intel talks about for being first half weighted. And then obviously semi-custom, you probably didn't as much in December as you did the first three quarters of 2020.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So you saw that a little bit in our Q1 guidance. I think our -- our Q1 guidance is better than normal seasonality. We normally see the first half weaker than the second half just given the consumer bent. What we see this year is a little bit of a different shape. The shape is, from a market standpoint, we see PCs and gaming better than seasonal. There's some pent-up demand coming into the first half of the year, and -- and that's that's -- baked into the guidance. But we're also seeing a strong data center environment. So we see server up sequentially in -- in Q1, and that's on the strength of both our current products or our growing products as well as the Milan ramp. So a little bit different shape than normal, but I think we see strong demand across our PC, gaming, and data center segments.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Good afternoon, Lisa, Devinder. Happy New Year. I -- I wanted to start with server, and -- and I modeled a much bigger dollar contribution in 2021 to the growth than there had been in prior years. And I -- I picked up on the prepared script, Lisa, that you mentioned accelerating growth for your data center franchise i -- in 2021. I think that's probably off a business that doubled last year. So do I have that right that it will accelerate in percentage terms? And maybe you could break down a little bit. I saw Alibaba in the slides announced. There's a Milan launch coming that I think could push you into enterprise a little bit more than you've been in the past. Some drivers of that server growth would be really helpful.

So, Matt, thanks for the question. We are happy with the progress in the data center business. I think 2020 was a strong year for us. We do see a significant growth into 2021. I think there are a number of drivers. First of all, I think we're seeing the cloud business strengthen for us. So going into the first half of the year, and as I said, that's both on the current generation Rome, as well as the next generation Milan. The reception to Milan is very strong. So we're -- we're pleased with the performance. We started shipments in Q4. That's continuing into Q1. You'll see -- we -- we expect to see sort of more customers, sort of new customers adopt Milan than perhaps some that had been on our previous generation. You'll also see a very strong enterprise portfolio. So I think we have a very strong time to market platforms with the key OEMs. And that's part of our launch plan later this quarter. So overall, I think we are optimistic about the data center in 2021. I think there's a lot of need across cloud and enterprise, and we think Milan is very well-positioned.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

My second question, I wanted to ask a little bit about supply. It's -- it's no secret that the industry is supply constrained both due to growth and because of some of the challenges with COVID, and your company is no different. Maybe you could characterize for us the -- the magnitude of the supply constraints and how much they might have been hindering what was, obviously, a really strong growth as it was? But -- that's number one. And then number two, I -- I noticed that a lot of folks had maybe thought that the big capex increase from TSMC might have something to do with Intel and -- and I think the incoming CEO there to maybe clarified some of those thoughts. But I wonder as you look forward through this year how your guidance incorporates increasing supply coming online and if you've guided to an assumption of better supply or what you have line of sight to with your partners? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,10,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure. So certainly, when I look at the semiconductor environment in 2020, it was very strong. So we saw a strong revenue ramp in our business, as well as across some of our peers. It's fair to say that the overall demand exceeded our planning. And as a result, we did have some supply constraints as we ended the year. Those were primarily I would say in the PC market, the low end of the PC market, and in the gaming markets. That being said, I think we're getting great support from our manufacturing partners. The industry does need to increase the overall capacity levels. And so we do see some tightness through the first half of the year, but there's added capacity in the second half. And then as in terms of how we -- how we think about these things, so for our full-year annual guide, we do have good visibility on both the demand side and the supply side.

Lisa, just one question to -- to go back to a prior one. I was hoping you could help us dissect Q1 and the 2021 outlook given without your semi-custom business so we get a sense for the di -- the different moving drivers of -- of the business both in Q1 and for the full year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So let's see. Let -- let me -- let me start with Q1. So as I said in the earlier that we do see the -- the PC market and the console business a bit better than seasonal. Normally, consoles would be seasonally down quite a bit, double digits. You would expect consoles this quarter will still be let's call it modestly down. We do see sequential increase in the server business, as well as in the graphics business as we ramp new products there. And then as we go into the 2021, I -- I would say we -- we're now at the place where we have let's call it three businesses at scale. And so the guidance really encompasses very significant growth across our -- our data center business and the server space, growth in PCs, just given the visibility that we have around platforms and platform launches on both the notebook side and the strength of our channel portfolio. And then we do see growth in the console business as well as there's a lot of demand for the new console. So I think those are the three big drivers for the full year. And I would say it's well-balanced between the three. And then, in addition, we also have growth in our consumer and data center GPU business as a result of some of the new products launched there. So it's a fairly let's call it broad-based set of drivers, particularly around the product launches.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And for my follow-up, it's -- it's interesting that as you're launching Milan, your -- your competitor is also launching their data center server. And so both kind of a near term and -- and a '21 question. So on the near term, there has been some discussion of cloud digestion. I know you're -- you're talking about your business actually growing sequentially so I was hoping you could address what demand environment you are seeing in the very near term from your cloud and -- and enterprise and HPC customers. But looking out to 2021, both you and your competitor will actually be on very -- almost the same manufacturing node. So how do you think that will play a role in your cust -- decision making of your customers. Because I think a lot of times that discussion kind of becomes one dimensional on who is at which manufacturing node? So talk to us about even if you are on the same node as your competitor, what's your ability, and -- and confidence, and visibility to take market share in this over CPU business? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Thanks, Vivek. That's a -- that's a very -- very good question. So in -- in the near term, what we're seeing in the cloud is -- is actually a period of strong demand. And so that's -- we saw it strengthening as we went through the fourth quarter and we see demand environment robust in the first quarter. So I think that's -- those are good signals for us. I think for the year 2021, we're excited about Milan. I mean it's a very strong product. You've already seen a bit of what Zen 3 can do in just our desktop and notebook portfolio. I think it builds upon what we did in Rome. So yeah, I completely agree with you. I think manufacturing technology is one aspect of what makes a product competitive. But we've been very focused on overall performance, overall system performance, how it performs in the cloud and enterprise environments. I will say that I think Milan is the most balanced product that we have both for let's call it enterprise applications, as well as for the broad set of cloud applications. And in terms of visibility, I would say that we have better visibility starting this year than we've had in -- in the -- the past years because this is our third generation with EPYC, so we're now on let's call it deep customer relationships. Many of the decisions have been made earlier as -- as they were testing out our product, and we have good confidence that we're going to ramp well. So exciting year for the data center. But certainly, we're -- we're pleased with how Milan is performing and the interest in the marketplace.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,18,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to start on margins first. So in the quarter, you had record server revenues. You said high teens, that'd put it to something like $550 million or $600 million, which looks pretty good. At the same time, like gross margins sort of barely came in line with guidenace. I mean they actually missed by a few kind of tens of basis points. I guess I'm just a little surprised. Is -- is that all console mix and was consoles like that much better than expected relative to servers that you wouldn't see gross margin upside in the quarter? And I guess the same comments on the guide, a lil -- a little bit of upside, but the same time we've got consoles down, we've got everything else growing, and yet we've only got a little bit of upside in gross margins. I guess if you could help me square that or -- or -- or square that with -- with -- with what you're seeing, that'd be helpful, please. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Stacy, be happy to do that. So first on the fourth quarter, I think we saw strength across a couple of different businesses relative to what we had -- what we had guided. So we saw strength -- a little bit of strength in the console business, some strength in servers as well, and some strength in PCs. And PCs, in the fourth quarter, tend to be a bit more weighted to the consumer side of the business. So those were some of the puts and takes. But from an overall sort of margin expect -- expectation standpoint, I think we were right where we expected to be. And then going into 2021, if you're talking about the first quarter guide, I think my -- my commentary was that we see PCs and consoles a bit better than seasonal. So consoles would normally be let's call it down double digits, and that's not the case in this particular quarter. We have server up. And so, again, these are just a few puts and takes. But we do see the sequential increase into Q1 and then for the full year as we see the mix of business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

I guess for my follow-up just to -- to push on that a little bit. So what are you seeing on the pricing environment, especially in servers? I mean your -- your competitor is actually talk quite actively about a more competitive environment for servers. We're actually starting to see some impacts on their ASPs and their margins. What are you seeing -- I guess what did you see in terms of server pricing, specifically those kind of trends in the quarter, and what are you incorporating in your guidance for price -- the pricing environment in data center in 2021?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,21,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So in the quarter, we saw ASPs in the server business actually up sequentially, and that was mostly because of mix, just mix between customers and the ramp of Milan. So as we go into 2021, again, I would say the environment's competitive. So I don't know that it's gotten more competitive. I think it's about as competitive as it's always been. Our focus has not been to compete on price, but to compete on overall value and total cost of ownership. As we go into 2021, again, I think, for us, APSs are primarily determined by the mix between cloud and enterprise in any given quarter. We're still cloud weighted and I would expect us to be cloud weighted as we go into 2021. But overall, I would say the ASP environment is about what it's been for the last year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Lisa, I'm sorry if I missed this, but can you speak to your expectations for the PC market this year? Obviously, there -- there's a bit of con -- of -- of concern following the very strong year in -- in 2020. What sort of embedded in your full-year guidance for the PC market? And then as sort of a second part to that question, if you can give us an update on your traction on the commercial side of the market as opposed to consumer, that'll be helpful.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure. Thanks for the question. So 2020 was a very strong year for the PC market. I think you've heard that from a number of the OEMs in the -- in the market. 2021, most people are saying let's call it mid single-digits type growth. We see something similar to that. This shape is perhaps a bit different than normal in the sense that the first half is a bit stronger than it would normally be. Our focus in the PC market though is -- has been very clear on sort of the subsegments where we could actually move up the stack. So if you look at our focus on gaming, particularly gaming notebooks and desktops, premium consumer, as well as commercial. And we made very nice progress on the commercial side. And I think that -- that business tends to also develop over a number of quarters. So overall, I think our expectations are the PC market will continue to be strong as we go into 2021. That being the case, it's one element of our growth and -- and, particularly, we're focused on growth in commercial, growth in gaming, as well as sort of in the premium consumer segments. And the Ryzen 5000 series that we just launched in both mobile and desktop have -- have actually gotten very strong reception from the OEMs in terms of overall platforms.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And then as a quick follow-up on opex, the -- the -- the rate at which you're spending is -- is very consistent with your long-term target. But that said, I mean you -- you are growing spending at a very fast clip. Can you remind us where the focus is today in terms of -- in terms of your spending profile and how do you see that translating into future growth in over the next couple of years? You have this 20% top-line growth target out through 2023. You just grew 45% last year. You're guiding this year to up 37%. Is 20% still the right number? Could we -- could we envision something -- something better? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,34,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure. So -- so I don't think we're going to change our long-term growth rate just yet. We set that in March and I think it's the right long-term growth rate. That being said, we're -- we're very happy with the growth of the business. And from -- from our standpoint, this is a great time to invest in the business. So the model has always been let's invest in the business, let's call it at a rate slower than -- than revenue growth so that we get leverage in the model, and so we're doing that. You can see the -- the -- the percentage of opex as a percent of revenue has come down over the cop -- the last couple of years and will -- will come down as well in 2021. But the overall dollars have allowed us to expand considerably, and really just build out the foundation of the company. So our investments are really across R&D, expanding our product portfolio. We've leaned in hard on both the --the CPU foundational IP, the GPU foundational I -- IP. As well as on the GPU side, we have split out the architectures between gaming and compute so that we have very competitive offerings in both spaces. As we go forward, more investment on some of the system IPs that link -- link the CPUs and GPUs, as well as investments on the software side and then investments in go-to-market. So across the board, I think we're becoming let's call it a company of scale, and that -- that helps ensure that we have sort of the -- the breadth and depth of roadmap, as well as customer support to support the long-term growth objectives.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking the question and -- and congratulations on the quarter as well. I -- I want to go back to the -- the Milan processor commentary. I think at the Analyst Day you talked about just continually expanding your ability to address workloads in the enterprise market. As we think about the positioning of Milan, how would you compare that relative to Rome and -- and how should we possibly think about the -- is there a potential ASP uplift that one should consider with Milan as it -- it starts to ramp?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,38,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So de --definitely. So we do see sort of ex -- the expansion of let's call it our competitiveness across the enterprise sort of workloads, as well as the broad set of cloud workloads. Our goal in life is to make sure that we're offering improvements in total cost of ownership to our customers. So as the performance goes up, we do expect some ASP lift as well. But overall, from a customer standpoint, it's so important that the -- the TCO really improve generation to generation. Particularly with Milan and some of the single-threaded performance is very, very helpful, and we expect on some of the enterprise workloads that perhaps can't use all of the course for -- that -- that we have will -- will be able to benefit significantly from Milan just given the uplift in overall performance. So we're excited to tell you more about it. Like I said, we'll be launching that later this quarter.

On the GPU side, I know it's been lumpy-ing. It -- it looks like it might continue to be a lumpy business. But is there a point in time over the next couple years that -- that you foresee that actually being a consistent incremental revenue growth driver? What -- what should we be thinking about to -- to kind of get us to see that as --as a key additional growth driver for the company?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,40,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely. Look, I think the data center GPU business is definitely coming in into its own, and it -- it will still likely be lumpy quarter to quarter just because the number of customers is not that large. But in terms of as a growth driver for the company, we see 2021 as a growth year for data center GPU, especially as the CDNA architecture comes into manufacturing and production and goes into some of the larger HPC installments, as well as some work that we're doing in the cloud around machine learning and AI. And more importantly, we see it as a multi-year growth driver over the next couple of years. So we feel very good about the CDNA architecture, its positioning. I think this is a important year for the data center GPU business, and it'll be a important growth driver for us over the next few years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Congratulations on a really strong quarter and year. Lisa, just had a question competitively on the GPU side of things, more so on -- on the traditional client side of the equation. You've done a great job taking a ton of share in the CPU side. Sounds like you're optimistic about what the client GPU business is going to do in 2021.

So the graphics business I think has -- has really been focused on ensuring consistency and roadmap, very similar to the CPU side. So we launched the first generation RDNA architecture that had a 50% performance per watt improvement. We launched the second generation of RDNA 2 just a few months ago. And then we're going to fill out that portfolio here in the first half of the year. And I think that consistency is important in the roadmap. There is a lot of pent-up demand for graphics cards and -- and gaming, and we see that, and we see it as an attractive market. So I do see that the consumer graphics business will grow in 2021. We expect to continue to make progress both with the OEM business, as well as the add-in board business. And over the coming years, there's -- the -- the team is working very hard on the next generation RDNA 3 architecture as well.

And I guess as my follow-up, one for either you or Devinder on the gross margin, you gave the shorter term answer for the fourth quarter and the first quarter, but I want to ask one about 2021 as a whole. It's good to see that it's rising again up to that 47% target. I just want to walk through the puts and takes on that. And I guess the -- the core question is if the semi-custom business is going to grow substantially as a percentage of your revenues, what's offsetting that to have the gross margin rise year over year? Is it mixed between segments? So server, for example, is going to keep up with that? Or is there something within the segments that is also improving, whether it be in semi-custom, or graphics, or -- or some area like that?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And you are right. Our semi-custom in 2020 is the initial ramp a couple of quarters, and then it grows in 2021. And with the guidance that we gave, we are talking about going from 45% to 47% as overall for the year on a year-on-year basis.

So the -- I think the -- the answer that -- to -- to what you asked is yes, consoles are let's call it below corporate average margin, although quite -- quite reasonable operating margins. Server is above and server is growing substantially in -- in 2021, and also the PC business.

Good afternoon, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, maybe I can ask Ross's gross margin question a little bit differently. I -- I would kind of argue given the -- the -- the mix in the December quarter and the fact that it was the first quarter of the console ramp that the gross margins you were able to put up were -- were -- were quite good. And I'm kind of just trying to understand how we should think about gross margins ex-console? And as we think about '21 unfold, typically in the console business, gross margins start relatively low, but there is good improvement over time. And so what's kind of the exit rate of gross margins in your 47 full-year guide? And I guess why isn't it higher? It might just be that you guys are being conservative, but it seems like you got a lot of tailwinds as the year unfolds.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

So again, maybe, Devinder, I'll start and see if you'd like to add to this. John, I think it's early in the year. So let me state that. We have good visibility into sort of the puts and takes in the various places. But, obviously, there's a lot to unfold over the next 11 months. I do think all the statements that you made are -- are accurate. So the -- the console business does have a history of improving over -- over time. I do think though that we'll just have to look at the mix of all the businesses, again, as it -- as it plays out. And from an exit velocity standpoint, we're guiding to 46 for Q1 and then 47 for the overall year, so we will see improvements over the year, and the --the key is what is the mix bet -- among the businesses in -- in any given quarter.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Then, Lisa, as my follow-up, it's pretty clear that semiconductors are becoming much more strategic to -- to nation states and -- and world governments and there's a lot of speculation that your chief competitor is -- is lobbying Washington pretty hard to get some incentives for domestic manufacturing. I'm just kind of curious how -- how you're trying to be part of that conversation because, clearly, given the IP portfolio you have, given the share that you're taking, I -- I would argue you're as much a national champion as anyone in semis, but it does seem like the focus is on manufacturing. So -- so how do you kind of get the year of Washington to make them understand how important you are in this whole mix?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And I think we all believe that. As it relates to what's important, I think the -- the focus on manufacturing is -- is certainly well-documented. I think there's also a focus on leading edge research and making sure that the leading edge research is also very well-supported in -- in the overall conversation. So we -- we can -- we participate in many of the industry associations and the conversations, and the key is to continue to invest at both the leading edge and in both research and manufacturing to sort of push the envelope on sort of the next five to 10 years. And that's one of the reasons we're investing as -- as much as we are and -- and we continue to also agree that it's important, as an industry, that we continue to invest.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

Yeah. So, Lisa, two questions. The first one is actually on the manufacturing side. I feel like people are poking a bit on the gross margin. But when you're looking at the company, you guys are having three products ramp up. So the question I kind of want to pose here is what would the gross margin look like if you didn't -- if you had yields similar to what you had about two years ago? Meaning that are the yields for TSMC and your -- I guess, your overall foundry partners improving at the same rate as a normal environment? And then I have a follow-up after that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,62,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Well, Mitch, may -- maybe let me start by level setting the conversation with gross margins. I mean we're -- we're right where our roadmap says we would be right. Our -- our long-term roadmap says given the -- the mix of the business, we set out a target to be greater than 50%. I think we're right on track for that. I think as we go through each of the product ramps, there are the ebbs and flows. But that being the case, I think the -- the yields are right on track where -- where we expect them to be as well. And the most important thing is we're -- we're now seeing growth across let's call it four -- say four or five large businesses. And so, again, there are some ebbs and flows between them and sort of a mix between cloud and enterprise, the mix between consumer and commercial, and then just the mix between consumer and data center graphics. So put all that together. And like I said, I think we're -- we're pleased that we grew margins two points last year and -- and we're again guiding to growing margins, two points this coming year. And -- and it's right on -- in line with our overall roadmap.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

You have it. That makes complete sense to me. I think it's very difficult to grow the gross margin line with so many yields ramping up right now. The second one is just in terms of the overall addressable market. I realize you guys don't guide by segment, but I think that one of the big things that happened last year is PCs are probably massively upside. So maybe you could level set us in terms of the three major markets you guys are GPUs, CPU PC-sided servers. Just what do you think the total industry is going to do? This way maybe you can give us, Lisa, an idea of what you guys view as a full year and then we can kind of come to our con -- conclusions -- our own conclusions, sorry, on what -- what that means for -- for AMD.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

So I think my -- my commentary was PCs, if you just look at what the various sources are saying, we would say sort of mid single-digit growth, and I think we would agree with that. I think server, as a market, if you take a look at enterprise and cloud, again -- again, they -- they have different growth rates, but let's call it modest growth. And -- and then gaming is hard to call because, again, it's -- it's a -- it's a different cycle. Within that sort of market backdrop, I think we -- we see let's call it 37% growth, and much of that is because of the product ramps and the product portfolio that we have. So we're pleased with the growth. We think we're growing significantly ahead of the market. That being the case, we'll have to see what -- what happens in 2021 because, as you said, the 2020 market was stronger than most projected at the beginning of 2020.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

I wonder if you could talk about your cloud business for server and maybe give us a sense, you've talked about in the past about the need to -- to sell twice. You're sort of selling to the cloud service provider and then they're selling it to the enterprises that they service. How are you doing with that and -- and where are you with sort of internal cloud workloads that are -- that they're internally focused on versus enterprise facing workloads within cloud?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 27, 2021","December 31, 2020.",1,68,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question, Joe. Yes. So if you look at the cloud environment, we call it both internal as well as sort of the external facing workloads. I would say we've done very well with internal workloads in the last couple of quarters, Joe. We've seen a number of applications just ramp here in the -- in the second half of this year and going into next year. So we're pleased with the performance on the internal workloads. We see that carrying over to Milan, and sort of the -- the -- let's call it the move from Rome to Milan is -- is -- is not too heavy a lift. And so we expect that that will continue going into 2021. And in terms of the external facing workloads, we've spent quite a bit of effort sort of building our let's call it sort of the business development engine that sort of let's call it sells along with the cloud vendors, as well as frankly enterprise OEMs. And so our conversation with large enterprises is -- is usually a hybrid conversation. It's -- if you want to buy on-prem, let me tell you what AMD EPYC can do. If you want to use cloud instances, we have a wide variety of cloud instances across all of the largest cloud vendors. And -- and that's actually progressed very nicely. So I think, overall, that -- that's leading to some of our positive commentary in cloud is that we have seen both progress on internal as well as the external sell with motion.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And then I wonder in terms of data center GPU, you've talked about some of the emerging applications.

Thanks -- thanks for fitting me in here. So I guess my first question, Lisa, based on your commentary on data center revenues and your splits and you answered the question before about ASPs in Q4. It sounds like server CPU share is running like 12.5% on your $20 million TAM-based that you use. So you have Milan ramping and you're talking about a lot of visibility on that ramp this year. So I'm sort of wondering if maybe you can give us what your guidance implies or sort of what the next milepost to think of would be in terms of server CPU share as you sort of exit the year and maybe look into next year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

So Tim, thanks for the question. What -- what I would say is I don't have a new market share target and I think just given all of the -- the variance in the market. But what I will say is we've given you a good view of the business through sort of the percent of -- of revenue it is. And as I said in the prepared remarks, the -- the -- the data center business was high-teens percentage of annual revenue and it was predominantly -- predominantly server. So the data center GPU was a very small piece of that, and it was predominantly server. As we go into 2021, again, we see significant growth. I would say it's one of the -- the key growth drivers for the company and we'll give you updates as we go along the way in -- in 2021 in -- in terms of how -- how it's growing as -- as a relative size of -- of the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/01/27/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2020-earnings-call-t/

And then just quickly on data center GPU. It looks like it was maybe flattish this year, year over year. And obviously, it's going to grow this year as Frontier -- Frontier comes in the year. Can you just sort of maybe give us some sense in terms of how much you think it could grow? I mean could it double year over year? I understand it's not big from a dollar point of view, but could it double year over year? Maybe just talk about how big Frontier could be as a contributor to that business?

So I think -- as I previously stated, the data center GPU business is still relatively small for us. It was actually down year over year. So from 2019 to 2020, it was actually down year over year because some of the cloud gaming ramps in 2019 paused in 2020. In terms of what it could do in 2021, we see it as a growth driver in terms of relative size. Yes, it could double. I think the -- the way to think about it though is we said that we would like to get that business to let's call it $0.5 billion as sort of the first milestone, and I -- I think we're making good progress toward that milestone.

Good morning everybody. I know a lot of folks will probably say congratulations, but, Lisa, Victor, I really mean it from our end. I think a great outcome from all and everybody's stakeholders. I guess for my first question, Lisa, on the deal, I noticed in the slides that you guys put together, obviously a pro forma model that combines the companies as of the end of the third quarter. But you also mentioned, as you did at your analyst day back in February, a 20% growth CAGR for the business. I wonder if that might apply to the two companies after you put them together post-close, and how confident you are in that growth rate, given that in the recent times, maybe Xilinx growth has been a little bit slower than the core AMD business growth, but obviously there's revenue synergy potential as well. So any comments there would be helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

Absolutely, Matt. Thanks for the question. So first of all, we feel -- we're really excited about today. We feel great about our base business. I think you can see that in the strength of our results in the third quarter and our full-year updated guidance. That strategy is playing out very well as we expected, with very strong products driving market momentum. Now all -- as we look forward, at our financial analyst day, we talked about 20% CAGR as the right target for our company. I think all of that stays on track. We are a high-growth business and we want to remain a high-growth business. I think Xilinx brings a lot of opportunities that are additive to that model when you look at the markets and the capabilities and just the margins and the free cash flow generation. So 20% CAGR is the right target for the combined business. I think we feel very good about the organic growth.

Thank you for clearing that up. I appreciate it. My question on sort of the results in the core business. You guys put up server revenue sales that more than doubled year over year. Your competitor had some -- a rather interesting set of results, some pretty disappointing results I think from their enterprise and government segments. And they guided for their combined data-centric business -- I know that's not exactly the same as server, but they guided for that to be down I think 25% year over year in the fourth quarter. You guys have some momentum. You're going to launch Milan. And I think you mentioned in the release some progress on the enterprise side as well. But maybe, Lisa, you could back up and give us your context of where the server market is overall right now and how it might mean for your revenue into the fourth quarter? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure Matt. So look, the data center business, particularly on the server side, is very important to us. We performed very well here in the third quarter, as you said, double from a year-over-year standpoint, sequential double-digit growth. We see good momentum across the cloud hyperscalers as well as in the enterprise business. We have more platforms that continue to launch here in the third quarter. As we look forward from a data center environment, I would say that the overall data center environment is actually good. As we go here into the fourth quarter, we are starting to launch Milan in terms of shipments to cloud as well as some HPC customers this quarter. OEMs are preparing to launch Milan platforms in the first quarter. And I would say it's very much a customer-specific message. Some of our cloud customers are going to continue to ramp Rome in the fourth quarter. Several are also preparing for a transition from Rome to Milan. But overall, we believe that the demand environment is good. And the thing that excites us is Milan is just very strong. It's coming in as we expected. Zen 3, we previewed some of that performance on the desktop side, but we see a strong translation into TCO benefits and performance benefits for our server products. So I mean we look forward to talking about that more as we go through the quarter. But yes, so overall, I think the data center business continues to be very strategic and performs well for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

I'll actually just focus on the core business. Lisa, for my first question, you're raising second half sales growth by nearly I think about $600 million or so.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So Vivek, thanks for the question. Our core business is doing very well. I think if you look at some of the components of that, the PC market environment is strong. If you look at all the work from home, school from home trends, I think that has certainly helped this year. On top of that, our Ryzen 4000 Series notebooks are doing very, very well. So we're seeing strong traction in areas that we hadn't been that present before like gaming and commercial. So that's one big element. We are ramping our game consoles here in the second half of the year. Those are very highly anticipated launches that are coming up shortly, and demand for that has been quite strong. And our server business has also performed well. You'll see us start with the -- you asked about graphics. We'll see gaming graphics here grow sequentially in the fourth quarter as we launch our Radeon 6000 Series. So we just have a combination of a lot of product momentum, product cycles. I will also say that our supply situation has also improved as our demand environment has gotten stronger. We've worked closely with our suppliers to ensure that we can satisfy as much of that as possible. And so those are all of the elements for the strong second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

I think we have made a tremendous amount of progress in the server business. I think the -- if you look at the leadership performance and TCO that we have with Rome, we've seen broad adoption across cloud as well as enterprise, and we've done very, very well in HPC. We think that Milan is even better. And our mantra to our customers has been strong road map, you can count on us, we will be there when you need us. I think the traction from Milan is stronger than for Rome. I think we continue to work hard with our customers to ramp as fast as possible. But you'll see a broader cloud adoption. I think you'll see faster cloud adoption. And I think you'll see broader enterprise platforms, especially with Zen 3. We talked about some of the single-threaded performance improvements that really round out the server portfolio. So I think we're very focused on the data center, and we'll continue to be that as a combined company as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

Thanks for taking the question and congrats to both teams. Lisa, as a follow-up to the first question, I wanted to get your view on some of the markets within Xilinx. You mentioned in response to the first question that you're comfortable with the 20% growth rate for the combined business. We've heard from Victor and his team over the past couple of years in terms of how they're thinking about their opportunity set in 5G, data center and the core businesses. But how are you thinking about sort of the three to five year CAGR for data center, comms and some of the core markets? Then I've got a follow-up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So clearly, when we look at our core business or the AMD core business, I think we feel very good about the growth in our core markets across PC, gaming and data center. I think the product portfolio is very strong. As we add Xilinx to the portfolio, I think we are -- we've both chosen data center as our strategic focus. I think the investments that Victor and the Xilinx team have made are very strategic investments in the data center. For us, we have the CPU and GPU strength. Xilinx brings the accelerator capability and very strategic SmartNIC technology. I think that's a strong growth vector for the combined company. I think the broader markets in communications, in automotive, in industrial and aerospace and defense, those are all very attractive markets that can use CPUs and GPUs. And so I think the market presence that Xilinx has and the leadership in those markets also help -- sort of have the ability to bring some of the base AMD technology in there. So I think, together, there are a lot of opportunities. I want to be clear though first and foremost, both businesses are executing very well, and Victor and I intend to keep it that way. So I think the base growth profiles of both businesses are very strong. And then we do see significant revenue synergy opportunities as we look out into the three to five year time frame as we bring these portfolios together.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

And then as a quick follow-up just on market share trends in both the client business and the server CPU business, based on what you're guiding to for Q4 and based on what your competitor is guiding to, where do you feel like -- where do you see you guys -- yourselves landing from a market share perspective in both the client business and the server business exiting this year?

And I think I've always said, this is a journey. So the key for us is to continue to execute very well. I think the customer momentum is definitely there and sort of our goal is to continue to delight our customers and execute well.

Thanks for taking my questions. For my company question or business question, in Q4, you're up 41% year over year with the guidance.

As we look into the first half of the year, it's a little bit early to be specific about 2021, but what I will say is that we believe there is some market phenomena here, but there's also very AMD-specific product gains that we're seeing. I think our notebook portfolio has never been better. And if I look at the strength of the new platforms that are coming up and what we see into 2021, I think we're really excited about that. Our desktop products with our recent launch of Ryzen 5000 is very strong. This is the first year of the console cycle. So the console cycle is a little bit different in the first year. I think you will see some very strong demand there. And then we're right in the middle of launching Milan and EPYC. So I think we feel good about the growth prospects into 2021. We'll get into a little bit more of the quarterly dynamics as we finish out this year.

Thank you. That's helpful. For my Xilinx question, so the idea of a CPU company buying an FPGA company obviously has been tried before. Your competitor tried this as well. It was not terribly successful to this point. How would you say your vision for what you can do with Xilinx is different maybe from what Intel might have viewed with Altera?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,23,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Absolutely, Stacy. I'll make a few comments, and then I'm sure Victor will have a few comments. Look, we've been thinking about this for some time. And I think it's actually a very different situation. Xilinx is the market leader. I mean, if you look at how their business has grown over the last few years, their market share has continued to grow. I think both companies are executing really well. So you ask why now? I mean why now is actually -- we feel very good about our base businesses. I think the -- people look at our businesses and say they're complementary, and they are very complementary from a product and market standpoint, but we have sort of important intersections around the data center focus and then also around the technology sort of strategy, right? I mean, we're both leading-edge technology users. We both are partnered with TSMC. We both have really leaned into this modular design environment and Xilinx is a leader in some of that -- some of the 2.5D, 3D integration. We're both invested in software and open source. So there are a lot of synergies that are sort of under the covers that we see, and we see very strongly, and I think you will see as the road maps execute. And then the last point I'll mention is I think our cultures are very, very aligned. And we're both -- Victor and I are both engineers at heart. We love the technology. We have a common vision. I'm really, really happy that he's joining me on this journey. I think we have a bold vision of what we think we can do for the industry and for our joint companies. And I think that's what we see as what's different. And as you know, Stacy, I mean, I haven't been big on M&A. We're not doing M&A for M&A's sake. I mean this is such a unique opportunity. There actually is no better match in the industry for us than Xilinx. So Victor, do you want to add some comments?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

I think you put it very well, Lisa. I think this is completely different than that transaction. And I guess I'll just lean into the fact that, as Lisa said, we have very common vision for the transformations that are happening, not only in the data center, but I would say at the edge and even endpoint applications. And I'm super excited about joining back with AMD and with the Xilinx team. And I think we really do have very similar cultures, very focused on innovating, very focused on execution and strong teamwork culture for both within the company and also with customers. And I think this is what it's all about. We're going to create tremendous value for customers. And I'm really excited to bring some of the underlying technologies that Lisa talked about to the floor, and you'll see that over time. So -- and personally, I'm all in.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,28,Mark Lipacis,Jefferies -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on the announcement. I guess, I would like to pick up on Victor's point about computing at the edge. It seems like there's a lot of talk at edge computing. It seems like base stations are a logical place for that to happen, especially as 5G is deployed. And as you think about delivering a joint solution, a joint AMD-Xilinx solution, does the architecture of the compute platform at the edge, is it different from -- does it differ from the kind of what we think about today as the core data center? And is the value proposition for AMD and Xilinx together, is it particularly advantaged or unique from the other solutions, other kind of architectural solutions that have been proposed out there? That's the first question. I have a follow-up too.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,29,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Mark. So look, we'll have a very strong portfolio if you look at all of the elements between CPUs, GPUs, the traditional FPGAs as well as the adaptive SSCs that Xilinx has been investing in. I think that portfolio lends a lot of solution capability when you look at specific workloads. So on the accelerator side, as you know, we've been investing on the GPUs with Radeon Instinct. And the focus there has been on training and has been on HPC environments. Victor's focus has actually been quite a bit at the edge. I think we share the idea that a common software environment is so important to try to accelerate the usage of those solutions in the market. And so I think we'll have sort of a basket of technology that can be used very well from the infrastructure cloud side to the edge and endpoint. I don't know, Victor, if you'd like to add anything there?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,30,Victor Peng,President and Chief Executive Officer of Xilinx,company,"-- Yeah, sure. I mean, I think there is a lot that we can leverage from a technology and architecture perspective, but I think some of the differences are, obviously primarily the workload and also there's more element for needing more real-time kind of responses, low latency. I think the fact that the workloads are different and you want to customize some of those things, that's where I think the combination of AMD and Xilinx is very powerful because we can handle a lot of the customizations and optimizations and fast real-time response. But then for some of the really very heavy compute-intensive things, there's a lot of great technology out of AMD. And putting the two together seamlessly also with software really makes that a powerful solution. And I think that's what this is about, comprehensive and powerful solutions, right, tailored to the workloads, whether that's the edge, even endpoints, and of course, in the cloud.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

Thank you. Follow-up is obviously there's going to be a level of integration with AMD and Xilinx products together. Can you help us understand to what extent is the integration happen on the hardware side in your kind of vision versus the software? Is it FPGAs and CPUs and GPUs integrated on monolithic dies or with the interposers or is there -- you have an architecture with a -- you demonstrate a successful architecture with Infinity fabric and you stitch them together that way, and then you have a software layer also that's integrating these things? If you can provide any color on that vision, that would be helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

Look, I think the days of monolithic integration are probably over. We've been on this chiplet methodology because it's the right thing to do. You get the right compute for the right workloads. The Xilinx team is also very advanced in thinking on this area. I think there will be some, let's call it, opportunities for us to do things on the hardware side, but I view it more as market-specific optimization as we think about what customers need. And then certainly, on the software environment, we are very focused on doubling down on the software environment because that's really the key to accelerate adoption. So lots of opportunities for us to bring the portfolios together, but really, I think the opportunity is at the solution level with customers and the important workloads.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

On the deal, you talked about $300 million in cost savings 18 months out. Can you talk about where that might come from?

Sure, Joe. So the majority of those cost savings are really on just the scale of bringing the two companies together, so if you think about our opportunities on the COGS side as well as some of the public company functions and those kinds of things. Our intent on R&D is we've been growing, and we're going to continue to grow R&D. I think what it will allow us to do is -- actually, there will be some synergy on some things that we're both doing like some of the IPs that are just sort of necessary IPs, but it allows us to invest more in things like AI and software and so on. So we're not counting on any major changes at all to either business from the running of the business. I think the emphasis here is that both companies are executing extremely well, and we're going to continue to keep it that way. And so Victor will continue to run the Xilinx business. And obviously, we have a lot to execute on the AMD side, but these synergies are really more from COGS and just public company type stuff that go on.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

As we look at the data center GPU space, I think the cloud opportunities that we have are continuing to ramp I would say, but the large HPC opportunities really come into play in 2021.

Congratulations, Lisa and Victor, both on the deal and Lisa on the solid results. My first question is just on the core business and gross margins. And I apologize because I've been bouncing around a couple of calls this morning. But Lisa, I'm wondering, how much -- there were some news presses in the calendar third quarter that perhaps the ramp on the gaming side had incurred some more costs than originally expected. But I guess, importantly, when you look at gaming as a percent of mix and the fact that Q3 is kind of the first gaming quarter which just tends to be the lowest gross margin quarter, it strikes me that September should be a gross margin bottom for the overall business. I'm wondering if you could just help me understand if that's a fair comment and how I should think about improvement in gross margin in gaming over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,41,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, John. So certainly, we ramped heavily the console business here in the third quarter. I think we were right at our margin guidance. As we go sequentially into the fourth quarter, we saw -- we see an increase in margins from 44% to 45%. I think there are a couple of aspects there. So we do have the console business growing sequentially. And so that is a bit margin-decretive. However, we also have our other businesses growing as well that offset that. It is true that the early parts of the console ramp are -- typically, we're working through some ramp issues. I would say the ramp is going quite well, and the demand environment is very strong overall. And we continue to work on satisfying all of the demand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/

And then going back to the deal, the rationale around both the data center and wireless, wireline is fairly straightforward and obvious. I'd love to get your view kind of on the broader industrial and auto buckets that Xilinx plays in today, the distribution channel which is not necessarily something that you guys deal with in your core business. And specifically, on the auto side, is there incremental silicon opportunity for core AMD on the auto side with Xilinx?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/10/28/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2020-earnings-call-t/
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 28, 2020","September 30, 2020.",1,43,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Absolutely, John. So clearly, there's a lot of synergy on the data center and the comm side, as you mentioned, but that core market business, Xilinx's core market business is a beautiful business. I mean if you just look at the product life cycles, the customer diversity and just how those go. So we're very happy with adding that to the portfolio.

And this year, we'll see sequential growth into Q4 just given the strong demand environment, but I think that's a result of the product space. I think at the -- when you talk about the competitive environment, I think the competitive environment, I mean, it's about the same. I mean I think it's always a competitive environment, but our focus has been on our product strategy and working with our customers. So I wouldn't say I've seen a change in the dynamic.

I think both of us have been very engaged in the top hyperscalers, and we will continue to do that. We also see opportunities over time in the enterprise segment as well.

As you know, with these road maps, many of these decisions are made years in advance. And so we look at process technology as well as design and architecture and leading-edge packaging.

Lisa, for my first one, when I think back to the last time AMD was really big in the server market was in that 2004 to 2006 time frame, when market share went from 7% to 26% in kind of that three-year-or-so period. How would you contrast the current environment, right, whether it's from a competitive perspective or just a customer willingness to adopt your platform?

Thanks for the question. So look, the server market, we've said, is very strategic for us. We think there's a high demand for sort of pushing the leading edge of performance. When I look at our road map right now, I feel very good about our road map. I think we have executed well to our road map. I think we are differentiated in terms of the performance that we're offering in the server market. We've always said that the data center market is a bit of a journey, and so this is about putting together multiple generations of strong execution. So we're pleased with where we are with Rome and the progress that we've made this year. I would say we're still in the early innings of what we believe we can do in the server market. I think Rome is a very, very competitive product. I think as we go into Milan, we see that as also a very competitive product.

For my follow-up, Lisa, so you raised full-year growth outlook to 32% or so, I believe, from 25%. Can you give us some more color on what in that upside? How much of that is coming from PCs? How much from server? How much from semi-custom? And I noticed that you kept the gross margin outlook kind of steady, and I'm wondering how do we think about gross margins going forward? How sensitive is that to your success in the server market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So we did update full-year guidance. When we look at sort of what's changed over the last 90 days, when we were here talking to you in April, we were actually expecting that there might be some COVID-19-related weakness in the second half due to macroeconomic factors or other things like that. What we see now is better visibility into the second half of the year, and so we had originally assumed that the PC market would be down in the second half. And we now expect that we will grow in the PC processors for the second half compared to the first half. We also see data center growing from the second half to the first half. And then we have our game console ramp that is a strong ramp here in the second half. So I think it's a number of factors. We do believe that the market is a little bit better than we thought 90 days ago. But we also believe that our product traction is strong, and we're seeing that come through with our customer demand. So those are the reasons for the guidance.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,10,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Oh, I'm sorry. Yes. On gross margins, I think that depends a lot on mix. That depends on — certainly, your question was about server. Server is certainly accretive to margin. And I think in the PC business, the second half of the year tends to be a bit more consumer-focused and notebook-focused. And so that's some of the mix relation there. And then we've said that the consoles are decretive to margin. We expect that consoles will be very strong in the third quarter. And although the fourth quarter will be lower for consoles, it's still going to be a very strong second half of the year.

Good afternoon, everybody. Lisa, I wanted to ask about the PC market, and you just gave some comments about maybe some stronger trends than you might have anticipated 90 days ago in the back half. But pretty remarkable for a notebook business to more double and for the second quarter to be your record client sales. I wonder if you might talk about the momentum, particularly in the notebook market of the 4000? And then how are you feeling the pull of the enterprise notebook market?

So the PC market was strong for us, and the PC business was strong for us in the second quarter and as we look into the second half. What we saw was that desktops were down as expected, but the COVID-19-type phenomenon has increased, overall, the PC market. And we see a strong shift from desktop to notebooks. At the same time, I think our notebook portfolio, particularly the Ryzen 4000, has done extremely well. We've seen strong adoption. We have over 50 platforms in market. We watch the sell-through and the consumption of those. And I would say it has been very strong, even exceeded our expectations for the early ramp. And our view is that the second half will continue to be good for notebooks and PCs overall. And that's part of this idea that PCs are now essential. And so we see strength in consumer. We see strength in gaming notebooks, which we had previously been underrepresented. We have a nice commercial ramp, and we do see good pipeline around commercial PCs as well as the education market is quite strong as well. So you put that together, and I think the PC business has performed well for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

As a follow-up, maybe a piece of the business that's been asked about a little less frequently over the last few quarters is your gaming GPU business.

So I think the Graphics, as we mentioned in the prepared remarks, was down year over year. We saw a nice ramp of mobile as we launched some of the Navi-based mobile products, but the desktop channel was lower. This was somewhat as expected from the standpoint of the second quarter is usually a lower quarter for the desktop channel. What we did see is that sell-through was pretty good, so I think gaming overall is good. We are in the process of a product transition. We are on track to launch RDNA 2 or, as you call it, Big Navi late this year. We're excited about the RDNA 2 architecture. I think it's a full refresh for us from the top of the stack through the rest of the stack.

So look, we are optimistic about our product positioning in the server market. Much of what we've been doing up through now, frankly, is making sure that our customers were ready to take advantage of Rome and EPYC. And so we saw some nice traction here in the first half of the year, particularly in the second quarter around some top cloud accounts that have started to ramp in good volume. As we look forward to the second half of the year, there are more platforms coming with Rome. We have a number of OEM platforms that are in the process of being launched. And we have additional cloud platforms as well. So I think Rome is going to continue to be a strong driver of our growth into the second half of this year as well as next year. We're excited about Milan. Milan is looking good in the labs. We're working with our customers on Milan, and we expect to start shipping that later this year. So I think the way to think about our Server business is, again, it's a journey, and we're pleased with where we are today, but there's a significant opportunity for us if we continue to execute well over the next, I would say, more than 12 to 18 months. But really, we see this as a multiyear opportunity.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then as a follow-up, we do an annual CIO survey here at JPMorgan. For the past three years, we've been asking global CIOs, are they thinking about or planning to use EPYC-based platforms for on-prem. And then the most recent survey that we did in June, we actually saw a 60% year-over-year increase in the number of CIOs that are thinking about using EPYC for on-prem. Our interpretation is that interest level and mind share is growing quite rapidly. I guess my question to you, Lisa, is the AMD — what is the A&D team seeing from an actual adoption perspective? And what's your sense of your enterprise mix sort of two to three years from now?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Actually, Harlan, I saw that data, and I thought it was good data. So what I would say is that we are making progress in the enterprise business. And that comes from a number of different factors. First is the availability of platforms. We have a very diverse set of platforms from our OEM partners that are now in market. We've also done quite a bit on the ecosystem and ensuring that we have the partnerships with the ISVs, and then just basically feet on the street where we're talking directly to some of these enterprise customers. So I feel good about the progress that we've made. Again, I would refer to the fact that mind share is a leading indicator, but there is a lot for us to do to convert that into market share and revenue growth. But we feel like we're on a good path, and we're going to continue to focus on both cloud and enterprise growth. And I'll also mention, HPC is another key vector for us, where we're very focused on showing a strong value proposition for those sort of toughest, most scientific workloads.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

No question, our business is more consumer-weighted today. I will say we're growing nicely in commercial PCs. I think the strength of the Ryzen 4000 product has been good for us. I think there's a lot of positivity around the performance, the battery life, the capabilities there. We continue to expand our go-to-market efforts there. We're partnering very well with our top OEM partners. So I would say that we're still underrepresented in commercial.

Thanks for taking my questions. I wanted to follow-up on that capacity point. What is your capacity and supply situation look like? And is any of the full-year raise related to capacity freeing up at your foundry partners? And maybe put another way, are you supply rather than demand-limited at this point? What does that capacity situation look like?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

So look, we have a strong supply chain. There's no question. It's been a very dynamic year if you just think about all the puts and takes over the last four or five months. I've said before and I'll say again, 7-nanometer is tight, and we continue to partner closely with TSMC to ensure that we can satisfy our customer demand. When you ask about the full-year raise, the full-year raise is because demand has gone up from our initial expectations, and some of that is due to the market, and some of that is due to the strength of our product traction. We are increasing capacity to meet those needs, but it is tight. And I would say that as we continue to increase capacity, we see opportunity there.

And I understand you're coming from a different place with the new product ramps and everything, so I understand why you are growing in the second half one way than not.

Stacy, I think it's a bit hard to generalize. And from our visibility, what I would say is we have some customers that we see demand increasing in the second half versus the first half. We have some customers who are a little bit lower. The main thing for us, and I think you said it, it's about the ramping of our platforms. And so I'm not sure I would point to a particular digestion phenomena. I would say it's very customer-dependent and depending on how much they built out in the first half and some customers will be up, and some customers will be a little bit down.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,31,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- So my comment was a hyperscale comment, since that's what you were asking about. When I look at enterprise, what I would say about enterprise is it's also different things happening. I would say in terms of enterprise and HPC, we continue to see build-out. And as I said, we have new platforms ramping that I mentioned in the prepared remarks. There is a bit of softness in SMB or some of the transactional business, and again, we were not very exposed to that portion of the market. So I don't see it as it's going down, it's just perhaps not increasing as fast as we wanted it to. But overall, it really depends on customer-specific stuff.

So look, I think the data center GPU business is sort of a midterm growth vector for us. This year, I mentioned in the second quarter that revenue was lower year on year, but the second half, we expect it to go up modestly. I think the view is we have good design wins in cloud gaming, we have good design wins across sort of cloud, VDI-type instances. Very strong in supercomputing and HPC around Frontier and El Capitan as sort of our anchor supercomputing wins. As it relates to machine learning and AI, we continue to invest in RAKM. We continue to work sort of our strategy around machine learning is partnered deeply with a couple of large cloud vendors who can invest in the software with us. And we see that as a multiyear opportunity. But it's not a big revenue contributor here in 2020.

And I think over the past couple of quarters, what we have seen is they've seen our performance capability, and we feel very good about where our products are positioned. I think what we've also said is, look, you can count on us for a consistent road map, and we're going to show you each of those data points. I think the Milan point is an important point for us, and that's why we're very focused on ensuring that, that ships here later this year. I think the Zen 4 general point, we've already started engaging customers. Customers are very eager to understand what the long-term road map is. And so what I would say is it's not sort of a short-term thing. It's more the notion of we feel that customers are very open across cloud, OEM, enterprise. It's on us to execute, and we think about that every day.

I think we feel actually that our CPU tools, infrastructure and all that stuff is actually pretty well built out. There is some work that we do with some of the applications and the ISVs to optimize and tune our software, but I think that's going very well. As it relates to the data center GPU, yes, I think there is more mind share. I think the supercomputing wins in the data center GPU side have really helped raise the profile of our GPU capabilities and our software capabilities. So I think we are in a good position there.

Apple has announced it in the MAC space, and there are some who are building their own in the data center space. I still believe this is not about ARM versus x86. I think it's more about what performance do you offer, what capabilities do you offer, where the overall ecosystem is. And in that sense, I think we still feel quite confident that both the PC market as well as the server processor market are predominantly x86. I think there's a very good set of offerings out there that are available.

Congrats on the strong results. Lisa, I actually had one short-term question and one long-term question for you. On the short-term side of things, you have some significant moving parts with new product launches, et cetera, in both the third and fourth quarter. So I was hoping, on the 32% sequential guide, if you can give a little color by the two end markets, the C&G and the EESC side? And then a similar sort of thing when you go into the fourth quarter, you said semi-custom will be down sequentially, which is kind of typical seasonality. But the ability for you guys to still grow sequentially, what's really driving that? And then I'll follow-up with the long-term question.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,52,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So let's see. Let me try to do that. So I think — so when you talk about the Q3 guide, so 32% sequentially, there is a large component of that, which is game consoles. So the game console revenue was relatively modest in the second quarter, and it's going to become larger here in the third quarter. But we do see PCs growing sequentially as well as server CPUs growing sequentially. And then as we go into the fourth quarter, I mentioned earlier that we expect that semi-custom will be down a bit, probably not as much as it's historically down, frankly, because it's the first year of the launch, but it should be down a bit. And then we do have product launches that we've stated around sort of the Zen 3 product families as well as the RDNA 2 product families that would drive some of the sequential growth in the fourth quarter.

That's exactly what I wanted. And then maybe this one will be a little clearer on the long-term side of things. An earlier question was asked about opex and expanding your capabilities, et cetera, and you gave a thoughtful answer to that. But generally speaking, it seems like your opportunities to take share in aggregate just improved due to your competitors' missteps. So when you look at that opportunity, how do you think about organic investments? Would opex staying at, say, 29% of revenues like you're talking about for this year, be a good way to capitalize on that opportunity as opposed to going down to the 26% or 27% you mentioned at your analyst meeting? Or within that, would you keep that a little bit tighter in line with your analyst meeting and maybe even consider going inorganic and tapping into the M&A market now that you have some cash and a very attractive currency to use as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,54,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So yes, let me answer it this way. So look, we are very excited about our organic growth opportunities. I think we want to stay sort of at that sort of very significant growth in that over 20% CAGR for the next couple, three or four years. I think the way we've managed the business is the prudent way to manage the business. And so opex will grow. Opex will grow, and you've seen it in the dollar numbers, but it's going to grow a little bit slower than revenue. And we think that's the right thing to do just to make sure that we do see some leverage. That being the case, because the business is growing so much, I mean, we are investing quite heavily in opex across the business in both R&D and go to market.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,59,John Pitzer,Credit Suisse -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, guys. Thanks for squeezing me in. Congratulations on a strong quarter. Lisa, it's really great to see embedded in the implied fourth quarter guide a gross margin that needs to go up about 200 basis points sequentially to meet your full-year guidance. And especially with gaming consoles being down less than seasonal, I'm wondering if you can just help me unpack that a little bit. When you think about the gaming console cycle, is the gross margin improvement available to you as that cycle ramps and matures? And I guess more importantly, when you look at both the PC market and the server fleet, where are you relative to optimal product mix vis-à-vis kind of longer-term gross margin aspirations?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 29, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,60,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, sure. So obviously, there's a lot to happen between now and the fourth quarter. But I think from the guide, what you get is we see the server and PC growth generally positive. If you think about what we have planned from now through the rest of the year, we do have some significant new products that will start shipping that will be positive from a gross margin standpoint. On a console basis, it is true that the console margins typically improve. Over the first sort of four to six quarters, because you would expect that, as we ramp into higher volume, that there are improvements in manufacturing costs and so on and so forth. So those are the factors that are in there. A lot will depend on mix, and the mix of the business being what is a mix of consumer versus commercial on the PC side, and then on the data center side, the mix between cloud and enterprise. And so we have to see how some of those things play out as we go out through the end of the year. But overall, I think the trend is such that you should see sequential growth in the gross margins as we go into the fourth quarter for some of the reasons that I mentioned.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/07/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then Lisa, as a follow-on, you've always talked about this being a marathon more than a sprint, and you guys have had a pretty methodical strategy to which you've executed to.

I think consistency in road map, consistency in performance expectations, being capable of ramping across, basically, what we're asking is for people to trust us with their most important applications. And so our focus is very much execute on the road map that we've committed to, and that's key for us. And no question, there's a lot of things to do in engineering to make that happen.

Good afternoon everybody and I hope everyone at AMD is doing well considering the interesting times there have been. Lisa, I wanted to start with a couple of questions on the server business. I guess, one of which is, how do you -- the EESC results in the quarter that you just printed were a bit below, at least where I had modeled them. So maybe you could talk a bit about how you feel the EPYC business is tracking toward that sort of 10% target you guys had set for the second quarter. And I notice in Devinder's comments on the June quarter guidance, most -- some of the upside is going to be driven -- I guess, upside sequentially is going to be driven by EPYC. So how are you tracking against that? And then the last little piece is, I keep getting more and more questions still about the timing of Milan. And I know you guys reiterated that would be this year at the analyst day. And if that's still the case, just let us know. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Absolutely, Matt. Thank you, and I appreciate the question. So look, we are very pleased with the progress in our server business. I think if you look at sort of the progress we've made, there were a number of key things that we wanted to see happen. What we saw in the quarter that we just finished, in the first quarter, we actually saw a very nice acceleration of the cloud business as we went through the quarter. I think as we go into the second quarter, there's an additional significant ramp of the server business. And so we expect to continue to gain share as we go through these next couple of quarters. I think what we're seeing from the current COVID-19 environment obviously there's a lot of puts and takes. But as it relates to data center, it's positive for the data center market. Certainly, we've seen some of our largest customers ask us to accelerate some of our deployments. And we look forward to continuing to ramp our server business. I think you asked about Milan and yes, we are expecting to be launching that at the end of this year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Just wanted to switch quickly into the PC business. One of the things that stood out to me from your commentary in the prepared script was the contrast between strength in the PC business globally versus the weakness in China. I imagine that weakness in China was both on the PC side and on the AIB graphics business. If there's any way that you help quantify that? And we've heard some commentary about the economy restarting in China. Have you seen some of those trends start to improve into the second quarter? Thank you.,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So the PC business has actually held up pretty well. So if we look at the PC business in the first quarter, we saw the rest of the world PC business actually get some benefit from some of the acceleration in demand sort of toward the end of the quarter. We did see some weakness in China as China was shut down in the months of February and early March. We saw that primarily in the channel business, so in offline channels. Now we have seen that pick up as we've gone through the month of April. And what we're seeing in general in the PC business is the first quarter and the second quarter is actually relatively strong with accelerated notebook demand and desktops sequentially lower just based on sort of the preference around notebook versus desktop in this framework. So those are the key dynamics for the PC business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,7,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thank you. You guys are one of the few companies kind of giving a full year guidance. And I just wonder if you could talk us through how you're thinking about the second half? Obviously, you guys have OEM visibility into a bunch of new sockets and new designs, but your customers don't seem to have visibility. So just a little bit more color maybe on how you are thinking about forecasting beyond the visibility that you have in Q2?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Joe. So look, we understand that there's a lot of questions about visibility as we go into the second half of the year. The way we look at our business is, we have sort of a lot of positives in terms of just market drivers that we do have good visibility too. I think our progress in the data center market is a positive. We see that with a number of platforms ramping and the number of customers that we have coming on board. So we see that as a positive for us as we go through this year. Console gaming is a positive for us. There's lots of anticipation around the consoles. It's one of the largest launches I think of the year. And from that standpoint, there's no change in our view as it relates to COVID-19, just given what we see today. Now as you look at the range, we have increased the range of our guide. And sort of the biggest sort of question mark in my mind is kind of the shape of the PC market this year. As I mentioned earlier, the first half actually looks a little bit stronger than expected, particularly on the notebook side. We are potentially expecting some weakness in the second half due to consumer spending. You sort of have the two -- the two forces are there. I mean, one is, there is a pull with the strong work-from-home trends, but then there's also the view that, from a macro standpoint, will be weaker in the second half of the year. So that's -- the primary variance in our model is what happens to the PC market. I will say though that underneath the market trends, we're very pleased with our portfolio. I mean, the notebook portfolio that we have in PCs is the strongest we've ever had. And we believe we have a good opportunity to gain share throughout the year, even as the market may be a little bit weaker than originally expected. So that's the reason for the guidance to try to give the puts and takes. And of course, we'll see how the year plays out.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then in terms of data center GPU, I know you talked a lot about the analyst day about the newer products and penetration of new workloads in the second half. Can you talk about the workloads that you've been addressing so far, cloud gaming and whatnot? And how is that business progressing before we get to the CDNA launch?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,10,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So the data center GPU business is an important strategic business. In terms of size, it's still relatively small compared to the data center CPU business. We are making progress, good overall progress in a number of workloads. Cloud gaming is one that has been a good one for us, and we continue to see opportunity in that as we go through this year, with the current product set. We also just launched the VDI instance with Microsoft Azure which we feel will be a good workload for us. And then we have a number of the HPC wins that we've talked about that are going to be based on the CDNA architecture which is an important strategic area for us as well as continued focus on improving our machine learning and overall machine learning frameworks and capabilities. So those are the key workloads that we're going after. And I do think it's an important business for us as we go forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Lisa, for my first one, I just wanted to go back to your EPYC server business. So very strong units in Q1, but it appears that the mix was very kind of cloud-heavy. So perhaps ASPs were lower than we are used to seeing. I was wondering if you could just give us some sense of how we should think about server ASPs going forward. And importantly, if you think of server sales for you for this year versus what you thought 90 days ago, how is that looking like? Because I think your competitors said that they expected some kind of digestion of cloud capacity in the back half. So I was just hoping to get some more color around ASP and just what you thought of your overall server business for this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,13,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure, Vivek. Yes. So that is correct. There was a mix shift toward cloud in the first quarter, and that did have an impact with ASPs lower. That being the case, the ASPs are very healthy. So I think from the standpoint of how our business evolves, it's within the plus or minus of the business model. In terms of where we believe demand will be versus 90 days ago, it's pretty similar. And the way I would say it is, we see cloud being strong. What we see is not just putting on more capacity, but really the ramping of new platforms. And so we view that as a positive. We have strong enterprise adoption as well. When we look at our pipeline in enterprise, it's continued to grow, and continued to grow in the first quarter and continued to grow in sort of the first month here of the second quarter. We do expect, perhaps at the transactional business, sort of the SMB type of business may be more impacted by COVID-19, but that was never a large piece of our business to begin with. So we feel good about the server business. And it continues to be a very strategic focus for us. I think the relationships with our partners and our customers are getting closer as we go through sort of the process of ramping volumes. And so we continue to view it as a strong growth driver for us on a year-over-year basis.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then maybe a follow-up for Devinder on gross margins. So first half, kind of tracking toward your 45-ish percent target for the year, but Q2 is 44%. And I recall, I think either Lisa or Devinder, you said that second half will be more semi-custom weighted, but that suggests some more pressure on gross margins. So I was just hoping you could walk us through how we should think about gross margins in the back half, given all the puts and takes of mix that you are expecting.

Thanks, Vivek. I think the key puts and takes, as you said, continued ramp for the semi-custom which has margins, as you observed lower than corporate average, but they are offset by the strength in the data center revenue. So semi-custom ramped the back half, and that does impact the gross margin being lower than corporate average. But data center strength, as Lisa just referenced, that we are pleased with the ramp in the data center business. In data center business, the margins are significantly higher than corporate average, and has the offset to help us deliver as we guided for 2020, the 45% gross margin for 2020.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my questions. On the -- first question on the client side. I guess, AMD has historically had a good presence on the consumer side, but it sounds like you're making great progress on the commercial side with the HP and ThinkPad design wins. Can you give us a sense roughly like what is the split between consumer and commercial on the notebook side? And like how does that play going forward? Does commercial just continue to grow faster than the consumer side? And is there an impact on the gross margin between -- if commercial does grow faster? That's the first question.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,21,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Mark. So our PC business does tend to be much more consumer weighted. I mean, we've made progress in commercial. Commercial has grown nicely, but it's still consumer weighted. We expect to continue to gain commercial share as we go through this year. As that happens, I think there's two things in the PC margins that affect PC gross margins. Heavier weight of commercial is certainly positive for the overall gross margins. I think the other pieces, we should expect that education will be strong and that tends to be lower in the mix. And so there are lots of mix dynamics. But overall, I think our confidence level in notebooks being a strong growth driver for us as we go through this year is good. And we continue to work on the commercial versus consumer mix.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

So when you look at our cloud instances, I would say that our cloud -- some of the cloud acceleration I referred to was acceleration of internal workloads at some of our top cloud customers. So I think that's an area actually where we get more visibility. Cloud instances in terms of numbers for external usage has grown. We announced the GCP platform. We announced the IBM platform as well as additional Microsoft platforms. You will see more cloud instances rollout over the next quarter or so. But much of the growth that we've seen has been around internal deployment of the cloud companies. And then as it relates to enterprise, it is more heavily weighted toward HPC. We've done very, very well in HPC. We're pretty excited about our new high-frequency SKUs that were just launched here in April. They're actually very well suited for large enterprise applications and financial sector as well as some of the technology sectors, and so that's a key focus for us in terms of growing those other pieces of the enterprise business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my questions. First, harp a little bit again on the server business. I guess I don't quite understand why a big shift toward cloud mix will drive ASPs down sequentially. I mean, your mix has been mostly cloud all along. So why all of a sudden is that driving ASPs down? And I know you said units were up double digits. I guess, in that context, what did revenues do sequentially? And maybe what were data center revenues, CPU plus GPU, as a percentage of total in the quarter?

So my follow-up. Again, I want to talk a little bit about the share target. So I know you'd said 10% share, give or take, by the middle of this year. If I even just take your entire EESC revenue and I take Intel's data center revenue this quarter, you'd be about 5% revenue share. And I know you're guiding for growth next quarter, but I mean, just given the magnitude, it doesn't feel like that's going to double in the quarter. So just how are you feeling about that 10% guide for the middle of this year? Is that getting pushed out? Are we defining it wrong?

Thank you so much for taking the question. Lisa, I wanted to go back to your full year guide. I appreciate there's a wide range of outcomes here, and you did put up an updated number. But if we take the midpoint of your updated guidance and we compare and contrast that with your old guidance, you are lowering the midpoint of your revenue outlook by about $250 million, maybe a little bit more. In response to Joe's question, I think you focused very much on the notebook business. Is that sort of the primary part of your business where you're lowering numbers or is it a little bit more broad-based across GPU and perhaps the game console business as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,38,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So I would say from the full year standpoint, the biggest variable is the PC business in its entirety. So that's notebook and desktop. And like I said, it's a variable, if I -- you can model various scenarios as to what it can be. And I think from our standpoint, when we started the year, we had the expectation of a pretty normal PC environment. I think we would all say that the environment is different than when we started. And given the size of that market, we have given ourselves a wide range. As it relates to what we thought before, it's priority PCs. And when you look at the other markets, game consoles, data center were about what we expected, and the signals continued to be positive in those areas. And by the way, I should -- I'm sorry, if I can just finish off. On PCs , I would say though that, I think we're all waiting to see some of the data as we go through the second half of the year. So I want to say that, like I said, there's those two competing forces. One is, there's a strong pull for work-from-home trends and the other is just what is the impact on macro going to be for discretionary consumer spend. And so I think that's a place where we lack full visibility. And we continue to talk to customers. And I think we're all trying to make sure that we are well prepared for any of the scenarios as they come about.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then as a quick follow-up, Lisa, I wanted to ask about the competitive landscape. Your nearest competitor continues to grow wafer capacity, as you know, and they talked quite a bit about accelerating the RAM for 10 last week on their call. Are you seeing any changes in how they compete in the marketplace, either from a pricing perspective or from a marketing dollar perspective relative to how you saw the market 90 days ago?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,40,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The PC market is always a competitive market. And from that standpoint, I don't think the environment has changed substantially from a -- either a capacity standpoint or a marketing dollar standpoint. From our view, it's all about ensuring that the platforms that we launch actually ramp into production smoothly. And so we've been working on that. And we feel very good about that. I think we mentioned that we have a significant number of platforms, over 135 mobile platforms that are coming to market here in 2020. And they're very, very competitive. They are some of our best platforms from just overall performance and capability standpoint. So we're bullish on our ability to turn that into revenue growth.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for letting me ask you a question. Lisa, not to kind of go back to the same well as everybody else, but I wanted to hit on the EPYC side of things. I guess the good news is you guys are growing very rapidly and taking share, and you reiterated that 10% market share goal for the June quarter. But overall, it seems like the number has not really upsided anybody's expectations over the last few quarters, despite the market accelerating from a demand perspective, your primary competitor upsiding their data center group or even their cloud segment within that for three to four quarters in a row. So I just wanted to get your feeling on, is there something that is capping the growth there? Is it the ASP is going down because of who the customers are? I'm just wondering why if the market is as strong as it seemed to be for the last three or four quarters, you're doing really well, but not actually upsiding our expectation?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q1 2020 Earnings Call Transcript,"Apr 29, 2020","March 31, 2020.",1,43,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Ross, the way I look at it, and I mean, this was very, very similar to the ramp that we saw in PC business. The ramp in server is something like steady as she goes. And each quarter, we add platforms. Each quarter, more platforms are qualified. Each quarter, they ramp. It's a little bit different from a pure market phenomenon. And again, I mean, I understand that there are market phenomena, and then there are growth expectations based on platform launches as well as software being qualified and so on and so forth. So as it relates to our expectations, it's actually going quite well. As it relates to the acceleration of cloud, and we're pleased with it. We're not ready to upside numbers at this point. I think we want -- we already had very aggressive growth assumptions in what we went through. I think you'll see us a little bit less market-specific and a little bit more AMD specific as it relates to our customers and their qualification plans. So I think we are confident that our data center business is doing well, and we need to continue to demonstrate that over a number of quarters.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Just for my follow-up, one that switch gears over to the computing and graphics side. Could you just give a little bit of color on what you expect for that in the second quarter? And then as you look into the second half, I know you mentioned that's the area of greatest uncertainty for many logical reasons. But any sort of difference between the computing and the graphics side, both in your second quarter expectations and then the puts and takes in the back half of the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

So we are expecting that the computing and graphics business will be down sequentially. So it's offsetting some of the growth on the EPYC and semi-custom side. Within the computing and graphics business, we see notebooks up strongly, as a result of the launch of our new Ryzen 4000 platforms and some of the other trends that we've talked about. We see desktop down sequentially, and we see graphics down sequentially. Q2 is normally a sequentially down quarter for the channel business for us. So that's not unusual. And we -- that's -- those are the dynamics in the second quarter. And as we go through the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how consumer spending holds up against the other demand environments.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, just my first question. I wonder if you could just help me kind of better understand in this current environment of shelter-in-place, how does that impact sort of new customer, new workload engagements? And I guess, to better kind of underscore that, just given that you're expecting pretty good share gains in the back half of the year, given your second half guidance, notwithstanding the gaming cycle. Are most of those wins already in your back pocket, and so you've got high visibility or how do I think about that dynamic?

So I think there are many that are already in progress. And that would be our -- sort of our typical view of how long it takes to ramp a customer from beginning of engagement to actual ramp, can it be anywhere from six to nine months if that's a good number. As it relates to what we see with the, as you call it, shelter-in-place, look, we see pretty strong activity. I mean, the activity level continues to be high on both the cloud as well as the enterprise side. The only place where perhaps we see a little bit of a slowdown is, as I said, on some of the transactional business which we had plan to grow as we go through this year, and that might grow more slowly just as people aren't focused on new infrastructure right now. But in terms of cloud and large enterprise, there continues to be good activity on both current already one design platforms as well as new pipeline engagements.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then as my follow-up, as you guys are painfully aware, one of the metrics that we probably focus probably too much on is just gross margin and gross margin progression. And given the gaming sort of ramp coming, it sort of convoluted the issue.

Q2, we came in at the 46%, Q2 is down, and fundamentally primarily is due to the ramp in the game console revenue.

Thanks for taking my question. I've got one and a follow-up. But the first one just kind of on the bookings you guys are saying. So I'm less worried about kind of the near-term revenue number you guys put up for server. But if you're sitting here today and you compare that to a quarter ago, what do the bookings look like or backlog? Has that changed at all? Is that improving? Is it getting better or is it pretty much in line with what you guys expected in terms of the overall backlog?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then the second one I had is just more broad. It's on China, actually. So one thing we're picking up is that a lot of the Chinese companies supposedly buying a lot of semiconductor chips ahead just in case they get banned from the U.S. and China relationship deterioration. So since you guys are not really involved in that, you're more exposed to the hyperscale. Do you guys have any comments on what you guys think is actually happening there, if people are actually trying to build up -- I guess, build up an inventory level for semiconductor chips they think may get banned or do you think that's kind of just noise, and it's not really occurring right now in that geography?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Maybe, Lisa, just looking at the fiscal guide, I'm kind of curious, if you look at first half versus second half, it seems like you still would require growth in computer graphics. I want to just make sure that was right. And then I'm just kind of curious how you think of the server obviously your share gainer. I think cloud and enterprise get intermingled together, particularly with this work-from-home. So I'm just kind of curious as you look at that business, first half and second half, do you -- I think Intel was talking about some weakness in enterprise and government. It's not a big exposure for you, but just kind of curious how you're thinking about, is there any headwind as that work-from-home spend holds off with server as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

So as it relates to first half, second half, I mean, as we said, there's -- the $8.4 billion plus or minus 5% is a wider than normal range for us. I think you can see outcomes within that range that would have computing and graphics up as well as you can see outcomes with it more flattish. So that being the case, so I think the trends that I talked about are likely the right trends which is the consumer spending, perhaps a little softer, enterprise and commercial, a positive for us. Notebook share gain, a positive for us. And we want to see how sort of the desktop channel behaves as we go into the second half of the year.

Look, I think from what we see, we see mostly platforms ramping. And so that's how we're thinking about the data center business. Of course, we're in this COVID-19 environment and so we'll have to actually play out the next couple of quarters. But within the ranges that we see, we see an opportunity to continue growing in the second half of the year, given the visibility that we have with customers, the platforms that are ramping. And I still feel very much like we're in the early stages of our second gen EPYC ramp. And I know it's been a couple of quarters, but that's just the way servers ramp. So we're in the early stages of the ramp, lots of customer activity, significant pull from the customers to get up and running as soon as possible. And as you said, we don't have as much exposure to some of the other end markets which may have more volatility in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/04/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q1-2020-earnings-call-t.aspx

Lisa, for my first one, you mentioned the goal to get to kind of this double-digit market share in servers by the middle of the year. I'm just wondering how the visibility is around in achieving this target? What's driving it? Is it just more instances at existing cloud customers? And as part of that, do you also have a share target for exiting this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Vivek, thank you for the questions. So, look, we are very pleased with how Rome is ramping. We've been in market now four to five months, and the visibility that we have is, with the cloud guys, we have visibility to the public-facing instances, as well as what they're doing in terms of internal workloads. And what we see is just the breadth of the overall workloads that they're using Rome with is expanding. And then, on the enterprise side, you know, with the full portfolio of our partners, HPE, Dell, Lenovo, and the ODM partners, you know, we see just a significant increase in the overall enterprise pipeline that we have for Rome. So, we're very focused on continuing to grow share in the data center market, and we feel good about our mid-year market share targets. In terms of our market share targets, Vivek, I think we'll talk a little bit more at our financial analyst day about some of the longer-term targets. But certainly, for 2020, we're very focused on growing our overall data center share.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And for my follow-up, Lisa, how should we interpret the impact of capacity shortages at your main competitor? Have you seen any benefit from that? If not, why not? And then, kind of Part B is, Intel did say that they plan to expand capacity later this year, and they'll focus it more on the PC client side and try to reclaim market share. What effect will that have on the pricing in the market? And does your full-year outlook kind of bake any potential impact of that competition?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, when we look at the PC market, we finished 2019 very strong in the overall PC market, both mobile and desktop. I think that's primarily on the strength of the product portfolio and the expanding customer platforms that we have. There are some discussions about, let's call it, pockets of shortages. But, you know, as I said before, I don't believe -- we've been on this steady increase in market share now for the last eight quarters, and we believe we've gained share in Q4 as well, so, I think what we see is just the portfolio getting a lot stronger. As we go into 2020, I think we are again enthusiastic about our products. In addition to the Zen 2-based desktop products, we've added Zen 2 now in the notebook portfolio, and we'll have that for the full year of 2020. So, I think our outlook expect growth in all businesses, including the PC business. And we remain very focused on expanding our market presence in both consumers, as well as commercial PCs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Congrats on the strong results, and thanks for taking the question. Lisa, this may overlap a little bit with the next question, but I was hoping to better understand some of the key assumptions behind your full-year guidance. For both your PC business, as well as the server business, can you talk to some of the TAM assumptions that you're making in the market share assumptions for the full year? And then I've got a quick follow-up. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,8,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Sure. So, let me talk first about the market, and then talk a little bit about how we're seeing the full year. So, if you look at the PC market, I think, the, you know, discussion so far has been, let's call it, 2020, flat to maybe down slightly. There have been some concerns raised about the second half of '20 perhaps be a weaker than normal seasonality just due to some of the enterprise refresh cycles that are strong in the first half. We're viewing it as flat, flattish, maybe down very slightly. That being the case, back to the comment I made with Vivek, I think we feel very good about our product portfolio, and especially when we look at sort of our notebook share and our relative opportunity to gain market share. The strength of our Ryzen 4000 series products is significantly stronger than previous generations, and the platforms are also significantly broader, so we feel good about that. In the data center market, again, I would say that the growth of computing continues. You know, from our standpoint, we see it as a good market environment for data center in both clouds, as well as enterprise. When we look at our full-year revenue guide of approximately 28 to 30% for the year, the highest growth, you know, from a percentage standpoint will, obviously, be server, just given the expectations in that market. But we expect all of our businesses to grow nicely in 2020, and that's just, you know, again, based on where we are in the product cycle and the visibility that we have with customer design wins, as well as just overall competitiveness.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then I had a quick follow-up on gross margins. One probably for Devinder. You guys are guiding Q1 gross margins to 46%, and then 45% for the full year. I appreciate your semi-custom business is at a low point in Q1, and a ramp in Q2, and more so in the second half, it's probably dilutive to corporate margins. But if you can kind of walk through some of the puts and takes from a gross margin perspective for the year, that would be helpful. And then related to that, if you can compare and contrast the gross margin profile of your semi-custom business going into the next cycle versus the past cycle, product cycle, that would be helpful.

Overall, from a margin standpoint, you got it right. We are guiding to the 46% in the Q1 quarter. And then the semi-custom business, as we've said, typically, is lower than corporate average. So, as that product ramps in the second half, obviously, will have an impact on gross margin. The guide for the year is at 45%, so we feel good about that having ended 2019 at the 43% level. And from a puts and takes standpoint, it's certainly product mix. And then Lisa talked about the business is ramping and growing in 2020 with the 28 to 30% growth in revenue. Data center, as we've said before, is above corporate average. The client gross margin is around corporate average, and some graphics. And then the semi-custom business has below corporate average gross margins. And that mix of revenue, as it ramps throughout the year, will obviously have an impact on a quarterly basis. From an annual standpoint, we feel pretty good with the guide at 45%, in particular, with the seven-nanometer products ramping as we get to the year. And that, obviously, benefits the gross margin. Semi-custom business, Lisa, you want to chime in on the difference between generation to generation?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,11,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. No, I think as you said, Devinder, the semi-custom margins tend to be below corporate average on a gross margin basis. Although, on an operating margin basis, given the contribution from our customers for the R&D, is actually quite good. As it relates to generation to generation, the way to think about it is, in the first year of a console ramp, you would expect the margins to be on the lower side, and that's, you know, that's true no matter what, just because you're just starting the product ramp, and you should expect that the margins will get better as that ramp continues over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Good afternoon. Lisa, I wanted to just start with a question about the, I guess, comparing and contrasting it a little bit, maybe a little weaker than we had -- some of us had modeled. And, I guess, due to the console stuff for Q1 in the guidance versus a really strong, so 28 to 30% growth for the year. Maybe you could just sort of lay out the year a little bit at a high level? And just how you guys are sort of thinking about it coming together from the point of Q1? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So with that, we're pretty excited about 2020. It's a strong year for us, certainly, with, you know, the expectations of being around 28 to 30% revenue growth. We do expect all of our businesses to grow. I think, relative to the Q1 guide, if you look at Q1 as an absolute number, it is up over 40% year on year, even with semi-custom revenues, you know, very low in Q1. And so, that should give you an idea of the strength of the rest of the business. From a sequential basis, Q4 to Q1, it's what we said on the call. There is some bit of normal seasonality, just as we are consumer-focused in our PC portfolio. So, you expect that that would go down from Q4 to Q1. And then we do have the factor that the semi-custom profile, when we're doing a product transition, has the revenue very low in Q1. You know, it starts ramp in Q2, but it's very heavily weighted in the second half of the year. So, you should think about semi-custom for this year, again, it's a ramp year, so it's a little bit different, that over 80% of the revenue for semi-custom will be in the second half of the year, compared to the first half of the year. So overall, we think a very strong year. A little bit of reprofiling of revenue, particularly as it relates to semi-custom. And you know, we look forward to executing it.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q4 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jan 29, 2020","December 31, 2019.",1,15,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- No, thanks for that. As a follow-up, I guess, for both of you, but maybe for Devinder, just a couple of little pieces. For me, it looks like, on the operating expense side, you're going to be up in the neighborhood of mid-20s for the full year in the annual guidance that you outlined. Maybe you could talk a little bit about the focus of that? Is it branding and marketing in the PC and server spaces as you grow, or is it in other areas in R&D? And then, secondly, I think you guys had disclosed the data center revenue mix. So, GPU plus server in prior quarters? And if you have that number handy, that would be really helpful.

You know, data center, it's as, you know, we said in the past, mid-teens of revenue. And this quarter, it is around the same, mid-teens of the total revenue. And I'll point out that it is record revenue in the quarter, so that's pretty good. And we feel pretty good about that, having mid-teens revenue in the data center, combined server, and data center GPU on revenue of $2.1 billion. As far as opex is concerned, you know, our guide for the year is about 28% of the revenue guide that we provided. And you are right, fundamentally, the investments are, you know, R&D and go to market, and obviously, the business is growing. So obviously, there's investments needed to go ahead and grow the business from an absolute standpoint, but we feel we can manage it to about 28% of our revenue overall for the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my question. I had one for Devinder, and one for Lisa. For Devinder, the -- I think it's impressive that the cash that you generated 10 years ago, you were at $4 billion in net debt. Now, you're net cash-positive. I didn't think back then we'd expect you to be here. But how should we think about capital structure going forward? And the -- and for the $400 million -- 440 million in cash flow from operations, I had a challenge reconciling it. Can you share the biggest two or three sources of cash? And then for Lisa, the last time AMD had a product cycle in servers, I think you were gaining -- once you hit 5% share, you started to gain share at two or three or 4% 400-basis-point clip per quarter. How should, you know, what is the right kind of cadence or pace of share gains in servers this cycle? And maybe you could just talk about, structurally, what gates your ability to -- or the pace of your ability to gain share.

You do have a long memory, and so do I. I do remember the days when we had the challenge on the balance sheet. And one thing we feel good as we end 2019 is the strength of the balance sheet, and in particular, the net cash position. We haven't been in many, many years, as we pointed out in the prepared remarks. You know, From a capital structure standpoint, the priority is investing in the business. The revenue is growing significantly in 2020 is what we're projecting at 28 to 30% over 2019. And also, we want to invest in the roadmap, the go to market and everything that's needed when the revenue ramps as significantly as it is going from year over year, so that's really the allocation priorities. From a viewpoint of where the 440 million comes from, you know, higher revenue, especially when you look at the revenue in Q3 and Q4 of 2019 compared to the first half of the year. We did go ahead and buy the inventory to go ahead and support the higher revenue. And as you know, when you sell that revenue, in particular, when it ramps up, you know, as it did on better margins, it generates the cash, and that's why you have the 440 million-plus operating cash flow from an overall standpoint.

So, Mark, as it relates to, you know, just server rate and pace. I think the most important thing for us is when we look at, you know, from time of announcement or time of shipment to, you know, how customers actually deploy and trying to shorten that cycle. So, when I look at the difference between, let's call it, Rome and Naples, we've seen that time to deploy actually significantly shortened with Rome. And so, in terms of rate and pace of server share gain, it is primarily for cloud customers. It is having them deployed, not just, you know, sort of a set of instances, but ensuring that they get fully built out across all regions in the world, and also adding additional workloads. So, it's just, you know, time, is what I would say. And then, as it relates to enterprise customers, I think the platform coverage that we have with Rome is significantly broader than it was with Naples. And so, I'm quite encouraged actually by the strength of the pipeline that we see, the number of customers that are engaged, and then just, you know, how they're deploying. So, I think we're going at a good pace, and we'll continue to accelerate that as we go through, you know, 2020.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my question. I had, first, a question on gross margin, especially in Q1. You said consoles are negligible. Gross margins are 46%, so that suggests that that 46% is basically indicative of the business as it stands without consoles. So, does that represent kind of the peak of the business on the current mix? I'm a little surprised it's not higher, given all the new products in aggregate, we're supposed to have gross margins in excess of 50%, and most of the mix today should be new products? So, I guess, how do we think about the Q1 gross margins in the context of that? And what are the drivers that take it higher from here? Is it basically just server mix, or is there something else that can help with that?

But, you know, Stacy, as we talked about product transitions, the 46% guide in Q1, we recently introduced the next-generation notebook products. And as product transitions go, you still have legacy product that you sell before you get, you know, converted over to the new technology and the new generation products. The desktop products were ahead of that from that standpoint, and that did benefit our margin in the 2019-timeframe. And you are right, the console being negligible revenue in Q1 of 2020, it does benefit, and then the margin is 46%. And from an overall standpoint for the year, it is 45%, and that's because the semi-custom business, which is lower than corporate average, does come back. And as Lisa said earlier, we're expecting 80% of that in the back-half of the year. But by that time, also, the new-generation products and the other businesses, including data center and client reramping all on seven nanometer, and that should help the gross margin to offset some of the impact that we have on the semi-custom business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

I was just going to add to what Devinder said. So, we don't expect the client notebook mix to fully cut over to the new seven-nanometer products until later in the year. And in terms of, you know, opportunities to improve margins, it is definitely product mix. So higher mix of server, as well as higher mix of, let's call it, Ryzen 7s and Ryzen 5s versus some of the legacy products.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

For my follow-up, if I sort of squint at the second half, it seems to me you're probably guiding it implicitly, call it, 800 million to $1 billion over the second half of 2019. How much of that do you think is consoles versus non-consoles, because it's not hard to get a console number, especially in the beginning of a ramp that's not that far off that number, which doesn't leave all that much room to ramp the rest of the business.

And so, you would expect significant double-digit growth in the client business, as well as, you know, in the semi-custom business, and overall, we see the aggregate of it to be a very strong year.

As it relates to the pricing environment and what we're expecting, you know, we're expecting a competitive pricing environment, and that's the way we built our model.

So, I think that's actually a good way of talking about the opportunity, John. I think the CPU opportunity is very immediate and in front of us as we look at the opportunities with Rome and the expanding opportunities. I think the data center, you know, GPU market continues to be an important growth sector for us, and now, I call that over the several year horizon. So, when you look at the opportunities that we have, when we combine our CPU and GPU IP together, they're very, very strong. I mean, for example, this is the reason that we won the Oak Ridge National Lab Supercomputer with Frontier, which are actually both the CPU and GPU win, and some of the optimization that we've done with that overall system.

We are in the initial stages of planning for the ramp, and you're asking about Q3, Q4. We are projecting about 80% of the semi-custom revenue, growing double digits year over year in Q3 and Q4. And typically, when we have this new game launches, our peak quarter from a revenue standpoint in semi-custom will be Q3. But Q4, when you talk about the ramp of the product, especially in the first year of the ramp, it's hard to project how much it will be and then what the impact would be exiting 2020 from a gross margin, excluding semi-custom. Maybe as we get closer to that and talking about three to six months, we can probably give you a better idea of that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/01/29/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q4-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So, I'm not sure I'm going to forecast a share target for 2020. I will say, though, if you take a look back at the last eight quarters, we've been on a fairly steady share gain in PCs, somewhere between, you know, depending on the quarter, let's call it, 50 to 100 basis points per quarter, and that changes between desktop and notebook. I think we grew somewhere on the order of four points a share.

Most of my questions been answered, and it kind of lines up with the model we got here, but I just want to make sure I got a couple of quick questions. And so, basically, for Q4, it looks like semi-customer is probably down 50% sequentially, or somewhere around that range. Is that -- am I leasing the ballpark? And then, secondly, from a server perspective, I'm not expecting you to give numbers on this, but maybe qualitatively, how much of your revenue is going to be cloud versus enterprise?

First one for Lisa. You had mention the total cost of ownership in your prepared comments, and I wonder, I guess, I could imagine that the total cost to ownership over a lifetime of a 7-nanometer server chip might be greater than the price of a server chip when compared to a 14-nanometer server chip. And so I'm wondering if you could maybe just clarify the comments you made on total cost of ownership and quantify if that is the case, how you see it. And how many -- what percentage of your data center customers actually look at total cost of ownership and evaluating the products? Is it -- does everybody do that? Or do some just look at the price? And I'm wondering, like, what do you think that has -- impact that might have on a competitive pricing environment? That's the first question.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,2,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Hey, thanks for the question, Mark. So -- I mean maybe let me give some context on sort of the data center business for us, and then I'll answer your question. Look, I think from what we see, there is a very strong value proposition for Rome. When you look at just what we're able to do from just the amount of performance, the power consumption and then how that plays into total cost of ownership. We see it across all workloads, so whether you're talking about a virtualized environment or you're talking about high-performance computing or you're talking about the enterprise sort of workloads, we see a strong performance as well as strong total cost of ownership. To your exact question, I think, server purchases -- or server purchasers are very, I would say, sophisticated. And so, in most cases, total cost of ownership is definitely in the conversation and it's not just about performance but performance at a given power level and also in terms of given density. And that has played out in a number of our customer engagements. And so the overall point of -- we think that Rome is very well positioned. Price in and of itself is one factor, but I would say it's not the primary factor. I think the performance power, total cost of ownership are all important buying factors, and we've seen very, very strong engagement from customers across-the-board, across all workloads for these drivers.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And a follow-up, if I may, on the -- when you think about your share gain -- your potential to gain share as you look into 2020, can you talk about what you view as the biggest potential gating factors in that and like how you're managing those potential factors? And I'm hoping you can talk to your view on availability of 7-nanometer wafers or -- and engineering support for your customers who are trying to put together solutions.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,4,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Mark. A couple different questions there. Let me try to get through it. I will say, since our launch of Rome in August, we've had a very strong start. Now we had a full quarter of revenue here in the third quarter and we saw that in sort of the ramp of units and revenue. What we are seeing is that the qualifications are going faster with the second-generation of EPYC than with the first generation, so customers are familiar with our platforms. In some cases, customers and doing drop-in platforms, and so they can take virtually the same or very similar platform that they had for first-gen and drop-in the second-gen. They're familiar with our architecture. And so I think from a market share standpoint, we feel good about the transition from Naples to Rome. I think the platform readiness across our OEMs and number of platforms that we have across the major OEMs is also very strong, and we're pleased with the set that are -- that have both new and existing platforms there. And so from the standpoint of where we are going in the fourth quarter into 2020, I think we feel very, very good about where we are with the data center customers. As it relates to customer support and all that stuff, like I said, customers are much, much more familiar with the architecture in the second-generation compared to the first generation. And that is good for the ramp of Rome. As it relates to -- I think you asked about the 7-nanometer ramp and the availability there, we had a very large ramp here in the third quarter with 7-nanometer. We essentially ramped three full product families: Ryzen, EPYC as well as our Radeon gaming product families in the third quarter. And it went very well. We're very pleased with it. It's the fastest ramp that we have done certainly in recent memory. And going into the fourth quarter and into 2020, I think we feel very good about the availability of Rome as well as the rest of our products.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,7,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I think what I can say, David, and I'll start. Maybe Devinder has some additional comments. The ramp for 7-nanometer has gone very quickly in -- here in the third quarter. When we look at overall new product revenue, certainly in the third quarter, we had a significant piece of that, the 7-nanometer. That will increase again as we go into the fourth quarter as well.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So if you look at the CG segment from a sequential standpoint, we saw the client CPUs increase the most, and those were certainly the driver being both desktop and mobile. Desktop was higher than mobile, but both grew very nicely. If you look at GPUs overall, they actually declined a bit sequentially, and that decline was primarily driven by data center GPUs, which declined just due to some of the buying cycles in the cloud. Overall, gaming did well. And we continue to expect that, as we go into the fourth quarter, you'll see that the data center GPUs will increase as well, as I mentioned in the prepared remarks that client and graphics would also increase.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Good afternoon. Before I jump into questions, just congrats to Devinder on being cash positive. The -- Lisa, a couple questions on Rome. We've been tracking some of the strength at Google, Microsoft and Amazon, but I wonder if you might comment a little bit about the server business in China given some disruptions there, just overall capex. And also, the OEM business that you're now ramping with Dell, HP, and Lenovo, and how you expect those things to trend over the next couple of quarters? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,12,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So Matt, as we look -- so let me answer the first question as it relates to the cloud customers. I think we are very pleased with the cloud adoption. We are engaged across all major Tier 1 and many of the Tier 2 service providers and I think we're making good progress there. As it relates specifically to China, we are well engaged there in both cloud and enterprise. Obviously, there is a little bit of disruption due to some of the China customers that are on the entities list and we follow that closely. But as it relates -- overall, I think we're -- we believe that there is strong pull for Rome both across cloud as well as enterprise. On the enterprise side, what I will say is that the HPC market has been really good for us. And so we have won quite a few of the bids and they tend to be early adopters of the technology. And so that's one indication of the strong value proposition. As we go into more general enterprise, the launch of HPE, Dell and Lenovo as well as Supermicro and the other ODM platforms is broader than our -- the first generation of EPYC, and we're seeing that in the pipeline that we see. So a lot of activity going on right now, and we feel really good about how that's going to develop over the next couple of quarters in terms of enterprise wins.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,13,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,company,"-- Thanks very much for that. Just as a follow-up from me on the client business. Obviously, a lot of progress that's been made with the results that you just put up. And I kind of go back to some comments made by your primary competitor on their call, I think, talking about tightness in their own 14-nanometer supply and also that they maybe not addressed some of the lower tiers of the market. Your ASPs are up quite strongly. I wonder how much some of the supply tightness from your competitor might have led to these gains versus sort of the merits of your own product. If there's anything you can talk about that, Lisa, that would be really helpful. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,14,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Sure, Matt. Well, the client business has really had a very strong year. I mean if you look at how it's played out over the last couple of quarters, I'll say that in our desktop portfolio, the third-gen Ryzen has done very, very well. It's extremely well positioned. And where we're seeing the highest demand is at the highest tier sort of in the Ryzen 9 and the Ryzen 7. And so that's why you see the ASP strength in the business. Mobile is also ramping very nicely and what we're seeing again in mobile is the mix of Ryzen is now a predominant mix of the business, and we're seeing actually very nice momentum in commercial as well as our traditional consumer market, so we also see good sequential growth in ASPs there. There is some noise in the system as it relates to some supply constraints and all that stuff. I would view that as mostly -- again, it's pockets at the low end. I don't think it's a significant driver of our business. Our business is driven primarily by our new platforms, the fact that we are in a number of premium platforms on both the notebook side as well as just the strength that we're having in the DIY channel is there. And that's contributing to the positive mix as well as the unit growth in the client business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

I have two questions as well. Lisa, first, on the data center business. I know you mentioned the target is still to be on track for double-digit kind of unit share sometime in the middle of next year. Could you help us level set as to where the share is in Q3 and what the target is in Q4? And if you have seen your competitor react to your server share gains in any way through pricing or other means?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,17,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. So Vivek, as you know, we don't necessarily want to get ahead of ourselves in terms of server share. But what we will say is our -- the Q3 quarter was our highest units sort of with EPYC. And so we are seeing good strength and predominantly a very fast transition to Rome. We expect that to continue to grow as we go into Q4 and into the first half of next year. So this is about more platforms ramping and multiple platforms within a given customer. And you should see -- we saw a number of announcements around our launches here in Q3, and you should see additional announcements as we go into the fourth quarter as well as the first half of next year. Your question about do we see any unusual activity from a competition standpoint. Look, our view is that the competition is aggressive, will always be aggressive and we're counting on that. It's a very competitive market out there. That being the case, I think we are feeling very good about how our product is positioned and also the readiness of the product. So the question earlier about are the platforms ready? How's the customer support? I think it's very strong. And I think our OEM and ODM partners have done a phenomenal job with the breath of platforms, and that will help us continue to grow overall.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And for my follow-up, Lisa, I had kind of a longer-term conceptual question which is it's good to see growth margins improving and the cost discipline. But do you think this is the time to actually increase opex a lot and really go after maximizing footprint, right to add in more resources, more systems rather than trying to optimize profitability? I'm just curious to hear how you are looking at the puts and takes around whether you should be maximizing footprint rather than profitability at this level.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Look, it's a good question, Vivek. I get asked it from time to time. But what you will see is I think we're very cognizant of where we're going. So in other words, the roadmap -- I mean, the long term sort of financial roadmap, I think, we understand pretty well. We want to show leverage on both top and bottom line, and that's certainly our goal. We did spend a little bit more this year than we originally planned, and that was frankly because the opportunities are very strong. And most of the additional spend is targeted at R&D, with the notion of platform investments, software investments to ensure that we capture the opportunities that we have. I think we have the right balance, Vivek. And certainly, as we go into 2020, we'll continue to look at that balance. But I think we are very well balanced between top line and bottom-line growth.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Congratulations, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. Lisa, I guess, my first question is, can you help me understand a little bit about the traction you're getting in the enterprise market on both Ryzen and in EPYC? And kind of what milestones should we be looking at relative to that sort of vertical?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,22,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So the -- we're very excited about the opportunities for us in the commercial space, and I will tell you, when we look at our go-to-market investments, we are putting a lot of feet on the street as well as just general go-to-market around commercial. Starting with Ryzen, I think you have seen and you should have seen that the number of commercial platforms that we have continues to get stronger, and it's not just the number of platforms but the quality of the platforms. Certainly, Lenovo ThinkPad is a premium brand that is very key. We have very strong HP commercial offerings. We have additional desktops coming out as well. What we are seeing is good traction in the commercial space, and that is the stronger part of the PC market. And we'll continue to talk about that. As it relates to new platforms, certainly as we refresh our mobile platform going into next year, I think you'll see even stronger commercial offerings there. We're investing heavily in security and manageability and all those other aspects that are important in the commercial space. As it relates to the EPYC in the enterprise, I'm actually very encouraged with what we see in the enterprise. We had originally said that we thought we would be more cloud -- sort of cloud would go first and then enterprise would take longer. I think what we currently see is cloud is certainly a big driver of our business. But our enterprise business is coming along very nicely. And I'd really would say that the key metrics there are more top tier brands adopting EPYC and talking about that publicly. We have had a number of engagements, and I mentioned earlier that the pipeline that we see in enterprise across our top OEMs has increased very significantly just in the last sort of two months since we launched. So the awareness around EPYC as well as the awareness around these new platforms, I think, is strong, and we'll continue to build that out as we go forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Then maybe for my follow-up. As we, the analyst community, looked out to modeling 2020, the GPU/CPU is relatively straightforward relative to market share expectations we might have. I'm just kind of curious if you can give us some help on the semi-custom business, if it's impacted by ASC 606. And also, we've got a new gaming cycle next year. I don't know you don't want to preannounce the customer product, but how should we think about the semi-custom business trending throughout 2020 in broad strokes?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,24,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So I think it's a good question, and we will certainly give you more guidance as we get into 2020. But the way I think about it at a high level is we are going through a product transition with semi-custom now. And in 2019, for example, we've had the unusual cycle, where the second half of 2019 is pretty soft for semi-custom compared to the first half. And what you should expect in 2020 is that that would flip strongly. So I think both of our large customers have said that they're planning a holiday 2020 launch. That would mean that the semi-custom business would be quite heavily weighted in the second half, so you should expect that revenue in the first half will be, again, quite soft, with a strong recovery in the second half of the year. And the way I look at it is, the gaming business, the console business is a strong business for us. And so it will be one of the growth drivers as we go into 2020 and beyond.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my questions. First, I wanted to ask about gross margins. I mean, I guess, I'm glad to see them up. But given what's going on with the mix, I think you said GPUs were down sequentially with data center up more than 50%. Ryzen's growing. You have the Samsung IP in there. I guess, I'm just surprised not to see them up more both in the quarter as well as into Q4. I was wondering if you could give us a little bit more color about what's driving that margin evolution given the positive drivers of mix that I think should be there?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And the margins are up. Last quarter, we had, call it 41%. And this time, it's slightly above 43%. And that is fundamentally due to the new products that are ramping and obviously some benefit from the semi-custom business have been down slightly in Q3 compared to Q2. So that's that. And then as you get into the Q4 timeframe, with the guide at 44%, it's driven by the new leasing products, demand for the high end of product -- of our product stack is driving a richer mix, and obviously, there's little bit of benefit as Lisa said earlier with a softer semi-custom revenue. So I think overall...",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,28,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,analyst,-- I thought it was new products were supposed to have gross margins in aggregate over 50% and you're driving like a massive mix shift. And yet you've only got gross margins up a couple points.

In each of the product lines, we are certainly mixing up, and that's why you see some of the ASP goodness. But you also have some legacy product, right? And we continue to sell some legacy product as well. And so that's the -- that's perhaps the other piece. But I think, as Devinder said, we're very happy with the way the gross margin has progressed. I think if you look at our long-term model, we had said 40 to 44 points, and we'll be exiting the year at 44, and I think very well -- positions us well as we go into 2020 and turn over more of the product portfolio to the new products.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the EPYC server ramp into next quarter. So you were up you said more than 50% this quarter. So that might be, what? $80 million to $100 million maybe sequentially, which is, I guess good. Your competitor added almost $1.5 billion sequentially in data center this quarter. So when you say next quarter that you're -- I guess, you did gain share. You got about 50%, your units were 20% but even so. So when you say next quarter you're going to grow it by strong double digits on EPYC, do you think that that's like better than the trend that we saw in Q3 is more of a -- more step ramps. I mean if we were up 50% sequentially in Q3, do you think we can be better than that in Q4? Is that was strong double-digit means? Or do you have a different meaning in mind?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I think we have in mind, strong double digits. So I would say -- and Stacy, I'm not being facetious, but again, there are all kinds of puts and takes. What I will say though is put in context that the product has basically been in markets since early August. And if you put that in context, and we're saying that the transition is going quickly, and we have a number of new platforms that are -- literally, they've been in market four to eight weeks. With the way the server cycle goes, I'm actually pretty happy with how it's ramping. And I expect, as I said, that Q4 will be another strong quarter for us, and it's just a matter of continuing to diligently ramp the platforms.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking the question. I have a question and a follow-up as well. Sticking to the server, the EPYC ramp. I'm just curious, out of the gate, what kind of mix have you seen maybe skew toward the 48 and 64 core solutions? And what I'm really getting at is how do we think about the blended ASP trend on EPYC as Rome fully ramps?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,35,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So Aaron, it's fair to say that initially, out of the chute, we are seeing a higher mix to the higher end. So more 48 and 64 cores as a mix. I think those are very, very attractive products and really take the full advantage of the EPYC product line. We are seeing, as you might expect, with that mix that the Rome ASPs are showing lift versus the previous first-generation EPYC. As we go forward, you would expect that to build out a little bit more so we have a full product portfolio for the server parts. But then you also expect that you'll get more enterprise in that, and enterprise tends to have a higher ASP. So the net of all that is, I can say, in the server market, we feel very good about where we're positioned from an ASP standpoint. And from a sort of unit share to revenue share, I think they're actually quite close.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then as just as a quick follow-up, maybe more of a model question. I think last quarter, you talked about the semi-custom business being down in the mid-30% range.

Thanks so much for taking the question. Lisa, I had a follow-up question on your server CPU business. And I guess the question is, when you think about pricing and sort of the margin profile you're seeing in that business today, how does that compare with what you had planned for six or nine months ago? Is this pricing and margin coming in pretty much in line with expectations or are they coming in a little bit better? And then as you think about the margin profile for that business going into 2020, given 7-nanometer potentially maturing into next year, given the mix and given the change in customer mix from cloud to enterprise, should those two dynamics serve as tailwinds for your margin in that business?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q3 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Oct 30, 2019","September 30, 2019.",1,41,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So I would say that the margin mix, as we look here in the beginning of the ramp, is about what we expected. It's about what we expected. So the only thing I would say, and I said it earlier, is the product mix is perhaps a little bit higher in the early part of the ramp. But overall, the margins are pretty close to what we expected. The pricing environment is pretty close to what we expected. And as we go into 2020, I think the other piece of it is that the business scale will increase as we grow the business.

When we look at both the client and server business, I wouldn't say that we saw any significant pull-ins due to tariffs or other reasons. We monitor sort of certainly very closely the sell-in and sell-through trend. And we believe that what we're seeing in terms of the growth of the business is actually just new platforms running -- ramping. And given where we are in the product cycle, that makes sense.

There have been some platform sort of optimizations that we've done through working with our OBM partners and the motherboard partners to try to sort of improve the optimization of the maximum boost frequency, which is I think what you're referring to. And that has largely been addressed over the last couple of weeks. But I would consider that more of a optimization versus any type of major update. And we're going to continue to improve the platform. So you're going to see that, as is normal with a new platform, that we'll continue to improve the platforms over time.

Just a quick one. As you look at your leverages for gross margins, what would you consider as your greatest leverage? Is it just sales growth as you take share? Or is it more products going to 7-nanometer?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

But also, the mix of the business comes into play. The more data center revenue we capture in terms of market share obviously helps the gross margin. The high end of the stack, in particular, in the client PC business, that helps the gross margin. So it's basically those are the things that help the gross margin as we go forward from 2019.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

I mean as a percentage of revenue, it's similar to what it has been the past few quarters, although the server portion was significantly higher as we saw -- as we said early, greater than 50% sequential increase.

And then I guess just a bigger picture question. In terms of the kind of competitive edge you have, some of it relates to process technology, but of course, your competitor could just go to TSMC to build CPUs as well. But I guess, there's other parts that relate to your fundamental architecture, which is the chip with memory density and your IPC advantage. So I guess can kind of break down -- Lisa, can you break down how much of the advantage really is process related versus how much is actually architecture related? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So Timothy, the way I would answer that question is, look, we made a set of choices, and the set of choices include process technology, they include architecture, our chiplet architecture. They include sort of our overall system architecture. And I think we've made a set of good choices. Going forward, we are not relying on process technology as the main driver. We think process technology is necessary. It's necessary to be sort of at the leading edge of process technology. And so today, 7-nanometer is our great node, and we're getting a lot of benefit from it. We will transition to the 5-nanometer node at the appropriate time and get great benefit from that as well. But we're doing a lot in architecture. And I would say that the architecture is where we believe the highest leverage is for our product portfolio going forward.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/10/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q3-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Yes, so my question is really just twofold. Number one, first on the gross margin side. So you guys have talked about semi-custom coming down pretty materially, and that's kind of the entire reason for the, I guess the mid-single-digit growth number. So why, I guess, aren't the gross margins expanding a little more if you're seeing more traction on the server side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,4,Devinder Kumar,"Senior Vice President, Chief Financial Officer, and Treasurer",company,"-- So I think, if we look at it from an overall standpoint, in Q2, we did 41%. In the third quarter in a row, 41% gross margin. And in Q3, you're right that the decline in semi-custom, there is benefit to the margin. And the margin guide for Q3, that's approximately 43%. I can tell you that the richer product mix, especially with the new products ramping in Q3, are going to drive the gross margin. Although there is a benefit from the decline of semi-custom also, the margin benefit is more weighted toward the non-semi-custom business, and that's where we end up with the 43% in Q3. We've also updated our guidance for 2019 and now are projecting 42% for the year 2019.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,5,Mitch Steves,RBC Capital Markets -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Right, yeah. So I guess, just a follow-up on that. So the assumption is that by the end of '19, you guys have more share on the server side. So I guess just high level, if I assume that 2020 gross margins are going to start going up as well if you keep gaining share in server. Is that a fair assumption for the next year or so?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

The product mix continues to get richer, and we'll see as we get closer to 2020 in terms of the specifics. But you're right, the product mix does get better.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,8,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question and good to see the traction in the new products. Lisa, for my first question, I was wondering if you could give us some more color around the traction you're seeing in Rome, both from if you're able to quantify it somewhat, but importantly, the traction you're seeing with customers, whether there is any pricing pressure from your main competitor. And I think in the past, you have outlined targets to reach certain market share. Just now that the product is out in front of customers, how are you seeing that traction with both the cloud and the enterprise side?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,9,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, absolutely, Vivek. Thanks for the question. So look, we are very pleased with how Rome is coming up. We did ship initial shipments this past quarter in the second quarter to both cloud and enterprise customers. The feedback that we're getting from customers is that the performance is very compelling both from a performance standpoint as well as a total cost of ownership standpoint. We've gotten a number of wins on both the cloud and the enterprise side as well as HPC. From our standpoint, next week is a big week for us. Obviously, we're going to officially launch Rome on August 7th. But from a customer pull standpoint, we see good customer pull. Your question specifically about the pricing environment, the pricing environment is always competitive. We expect it to be competitive. That being the case, in servers, price is not the first variable in terms of a buying decision. And so we believe the value proposition that we have for Rome from an overall standpoint is very strong and we see a good pricing environment for that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And as my follow-up, on the quantification side, I think in the last quarter, you had given us some color around data centers, CPU and GPU kind of around that mid-teens as a percentage of sales. I was hoping you could give us some sense of what it was in Q2 and just what the outlook is for 2019 or the second half of the year.

So in the second quarter, the percentages are similar to the past few quarters in terms of percentage of our business. We were more heavily weighted toward CPU versus GPU in the second quarter, so we saw data center GPU sequentially decline as expected. The CPUs grew as expected. As we go into the second half of the year, you should expect that the percentage of our revenue through the data center will increase as we ramp Rome.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So look, we certainly have heard the same conversation, especially around the cloud environment in the first half of the year. Our plan was always very heavily second half weighted. And from our standpoint, we have seen significant customer engagement and pull for the Rome product, and we see a number of new installations that will come online over the next couple of quarters. So I believe that there is some cloud digestion that's happening out there.

And then as a follow-up, I was hoping to learn a little bit more about the partnership with Samsung, the IP win in the quarter and also Frontier on the HPC side.

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,16,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So look, we're very pleased with both. They're both very significant announcements for us. On the Samsung side, it's a multiyear, multigenerational deal that we have across our graphics portfolio for mobile. In terms of 2019, the revenue is approximately $100 million that would be added. This was not originally in our guidance, and it offsets some of the headwinds that we talked about in semi-custom and in China. As it -- it's not pure IP, though, so the way you should think about it is there is some specific development expenses that are being -- that are part of that deal. And so those will be part of the COGS portion of that. As it relates to Frontier, Frontier again, very significant deal for us. It is NRE for the next couple of years to really get the software and infrastructure. I would say, that's not material. And it's a relatively smaller number. And then, the actual deployment will be in 2021. So the bulk of the CPU and the GPU revenue will be in 2021, with a small portion of that perhaps in the second half of 2020.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Good afternoon. Lisa, I think we'll be hearing plenty about Rome next week. I wanted to ask some questions about your PC business going into the back half of the year. The desktop momentum seems there. The notebook space, Intel is obviously going on to 10-nanometer for a portion of that portfolio. And it seems the 7-nanometer refresh on your side is a little bit later, yet the SKU coverage you've talked about, I think, is 50% higher than it was last year for back-to-school and holidays. So maybe you could talk a little bit about the momentum in the PC business into the back half and the differences between what you might see in desktop and notebook. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,19,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. So we're pleased with the progress of our PC business. In the second quarter, we had notebook perform very well. We saw a ramp of our second-generation mobile product, and that is due to some of the additional platforms that we mentioned. Going into the second half of the year, on the desktop side, our third-generation Ryzen products are very well positioned. We expect to ramp significant production here in the third quarter. And we expect that to lead to share gains. And we're also feeling quite good about the mobile products into the second half of the year. We made progress on both consumer and commercial. We had always been strong in consumer, but on the commercial side, we have a number of new platforms as well, and those are ramping here into the second half of the year. So overall, I think the PC business continues to be a good opportunity for us to gain share through the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And as a follow-up for me, a couple things for Devinder. I wonder if you might talk about the margin or gross margin differential between some of the new 7-nanometer products that you're rolling out versus some of the predecessor products that were either on 12 or 14, just so we can get an understanding on magnitude. And before you take that, just congrats on cash positive for the company overall, even in some of the verticals.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Yeah. So on the margin side, the new products, as we have said previously, in aggregate are greater than 50% margin. And so as we launch the new products, in particular on the 7-nanometer node, those are accretive. And that's why you see us updating the guidance in terms of the margin not just for the quarter in Q3 but also for the year. And from that standpoint, as the product mix gets richer with more 7-nanometer products ramping, that should benefit the gross margin.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So look, Mark, I think all products have really performed quite well. I think the third-generation Ryzen desktop, both in terms of the reviews -- third-party reviews as well as just the customer interest, what we see is obviously it's only been in market for three weeks, and so we watch the data points very carefully. But across the globe, we're seeing sort of significant uptick in our share in the desktop market. I think Navi has come out positioned very well. We're very pleased with our RDNA architecture. Navi is the first step, and we have a couple more steps going. And then we'll talk much more about EPYC next week. I think the key thing is the products have been on schedule and at or above the performance. So our goal is of course to turn that into revenue growth in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thank you. And a follow-up if I may, you mentioned the gen five game console wins at Microsoft and Sony. Can you give us a sense, when do these start to ramp? When they ramp, do you book the revenues as you build inventory as you did in the previous generation? And is there going to be -- should we think about anything differently on the gross margin profile? Is it going to be similar to what you've had in the past on these things?

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,32,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. So Mark, we're proud of the wins at Sony and Microsoft. Those are big wins for us and, as you know, over many years. We can't comment on specific customers and their ramp profiles. The only thing I will say is, you can expect that in general, consumer ramps are second half weighted, especially weighted toward the holiday season. And you would expect that. And then as it relates to the gross margin profiles, with our semi-custom business model, I think the margins will be under the corporate average. However, our business model is actually quite different. If you look forward to our business model, the growth that we see across all of our other products, Ryzen, EPYC, Radeon is actually quite significant. And so the percentage of semi-custom as a percent of the overall business will be lower than, for example, in the last few years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Thanks for taking my questions. For my first one, I want to follow up on that second half gross margin question again. I want to put some numbers behind it. So you're guiding 43% for Q3. Your implied guidance for Q4 is 43% and maybe a little under. It's only up about 150 bps year-over-year and flat sequentially, but you're guiding Q4 revenues of over 50% year-over-year. And consoles have to be falling like 40% to 50% sequentially, so the mix has to be massively switching over to the new products that, in aggregate, have gross over 50%. Why are gross margins only being guided up like 160 bps year-over-year in Q4 given that kind of a revenue trajectory? And why is it only flat sequentially even with revenues growing over 20% quarter-on-quarter into Q4? I just I don't understand.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Stacy, let me start, and then maybe Devinder can add to it. So we guide approximately to full margin points. What you should expect as we go from Q3 to Q4 is that the product mix will get better, so we will expect more new products. And from the standpoint of semi-custom, semi-custom will be down sequentially Q3 to Q4. And so you should expect that we are not implying that the margin will be down in Q4, and we'll get to the Q4 guide as we get through the next 90 days.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

For my follow-up, the $100 million from Samsung, did your 20% year-over-year growth excluding the semi-custom include that $100 million that wasn't in the prior guidance?

Thanks for taking the question. I have one question and a follow-up as well. Just building on that last kind of question, I think the last couple of quarters, you've talked about your semi-custom business being down somewhere in the 20% plus range. It looks like by my math, your assumption now is that that business declines maybe as much as 40-plus percent. And so when you parse through that, you kind of factor in the Samsung relationship and the incremental $100 million revenue, has your estimate at all changed ex those items? Meaning, revenue ex the semi-custom decline and then also ex the $100 million Samsung?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,43,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So let me try to help you, Aaron, with that math. So look, originally, when we started the year, we thought semi-custom would be down, let's call it, approximately 20%. In the first half of the year it was down more than that. And based on what we see today, we would expect the full year now to be down, let's call it, mid-30s year-on-year. If you talk about now the rest of the business, I think the rest of the business is close to where we thought it would be, close plus or minus a couple percent. And if you think about all of the moving pieces, we do have some customers that were not shipping to -- in China. That is offset by the Samsung upside and with the new products and how they're coming in. So I think we are pretty close plus or minus to where we thought we would be ex those factors.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

That's very helpful. And then just looking at your product segmentation, I'm curious as how you think about the trajectory of the data center GPU business going forward. Obviously, I can appreciate that could be lumpy, but I'm just trying to understand how you see that. Is there a point in time when we can actually get some better visibility into that incremental growth driver or revenue stream going forward?

I think that's a fair comment. It is a little bit lumpy because of its size and it's fairly concentrated in a couple of customers. I will say that we're going to see very nice year-over-year growth this year, and we see good customer momentum across both cloud as well as HPC. On the cloud side, it is both, let's call it cloud streaming/gaming as well as machine learning. And on the HPC side, the Frontier win is a public win, but we have a number of others that we're working as well. So I think we give more color as we go forward, but it continues to be a business that we feel will be a good growth driver over the next few years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So the second quarter we saw a sequentially mobile units up, and we saw desktop units down.

A quick follow-up. It was part of a prior question that I don't think I heard the answer to. But is the accounting for the semi-custom ramp, whenever it may occur next year, the same in so far as when you build it, you recognize the revenue?

The only difference, though, is we tend -- we would not ramp a product prior to qualification.

I also had a clarification, Lisa. I'm not sure I quite understood. In the delta for revenues, you talked about semi-custom, and then you also said that China is having an impact. What specific product areas are those? And is that -- THATIC is also part of that? And then I have a follow-up for Devinder.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

So we did have a small impact due to China. We have several customers that are now on the U.S. entities list, and we stopped shipping to those customers in the second quarter. And so it's a small impact, but there is impact that is offset by some of the positives in the rest of the business.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then Devinder, my follow-up is on free cash flow. The gap between free cash flow per share and earnings per share is massive. If I look at the first two quarters, roughly $300 million, negative free cash flow, but you're guiding for positive -- for the full year. Can you put some numbers around that?

Thanks for taking my question. I'm just curious on the notebook market. Intel talked about some pull-ins, but also ensuring the market. You're ramping products. Just wondering if you can parse those items out because notebook was pretty strong for you in June. Just curious if that impacts any seasonality at the end of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

From our standpoint, our notebook ramps were due to platform breadth. We ramped a number of second-generation platforms as well as some new Chrome platforms. I can't say that I can point to any particular pull-ins, per se. I think we're still expecting that we have -- we see a seasonal uplift in the second half of the year.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,85,Timothy Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. Lisa, so for my first question, I just wanted to ask how you think about semi-custom sort of over the longer term? And talk maybe about cloud gaming and sort of how you think about its long-term effect on you. Because on one hand you've done quite well with some of these big launches coming up, but you're also exposed to some potential cannibalization on the semi-custom side. So I'm wondering how you think about those two factors?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,86,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, so look, I think we like sort of gaming overall. So if you think about gaming overall, there's PC gaming, there's cloud gaming and then there's console gaming. We believe a rich ecosystem is important. We want to have our Radeon graphics architecture across all those three segments. I've been asked about the cannibalization question, I think it's too early to talk about that. Maybe in a few years. I mean, we think cloud gaming is going to be important, but it's too early to say whether it's really a cannibalization thing, or is it an additive, getting access to more users overall. So our goal is to make sure that our architecture is very friendly to all segments of gaming.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx

And then I just wanted to go back to the question that Ross just asked about, the server share target. So it's not that you're not reiterating that target here. It's more that you're going to update us on the target when you launch Rome. Is that the right way to think about it?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2019/07/30/advanced-micro-devices-amd-q2-2019-earnings-call-t.aspx
Advanced Micro Devices,Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Q2 2019 Earnings Call Transcript,"Jul 30, 2019","June 30, 2019.",1,88,Lisa Su,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- No. Let me say it this way.
