positive,0.9553984,"-- So the only thing I'll add, Ross, I think as you know, the situation is pretty tight, as we talked about the overall global supply situation in semiconductors. So we are seeing some increases in component costs, but overall we are managing it. On the higher revenue by more than $1 billion, we are maintaining the 47% guide for 2021, which is up from last year. And last quarter was 45%, this quarter 46%, guiding 47%. The trend is very good, and we are very, very happy with that."
positive,0.9552738,"-- Yeah. So Q4, you know, it is up slightly based from our guidance, 1 point from Q3, and that's really product mix, higher margin from server, offset by semi-custom revenue also been higher going from Q3 to Q4. So we're very pleased with the progress on the gross margin. As you look at the Q3 results, up 440 basis points from last year, up 80 basis points from last quarter and the progression into Q4, obviously driven by the server, our revenue growing. I'm very pleased with that also."
positive,0.9540266,"-- Yeah. I mean as a percentage of revenue, it's similar to what it has been the past few quarters, although the server portion was significantly higher as we saw -- as we said early, greater than 50% sequential increase. And so the CPU revenue -- unit shipment and revenue, so that definitely helps."
positive,0.951672,"-- Yeah, sure. Ross, thanks for the question. I think the -- our EPYC business has actually performed pretty well. The market is a bit mixed. I think some of the cloud guys are still working through sort of their optimizations. I think it's different by customer. We did see here in the first quarter actually some very nice early signs in the enterprise space, sort of large customers starting refresh programs. The value proposition of Genoa is very, very strong, and we're seeing that pull through across the enterprise. In the second quarter, we expect overall data center to be up strong double digits. And then within that, we expect server to be up as well. And as we go into the second half of the year, I think there are a couple of drivers for us. We do expect some improvement in the overall market conditions for the server business, but we also have our Turin launch in the second half of the year. That will also, we believe, extend our leadership position within the server market. So overall, I think the business is performing well, and we believe that we're continuing to be very well positioned to gain share throughout the year."
positive,0.94804955,"-- Yes. I think the way to look at our Q4 performance is our data center business overall did really well. It actually is consistent with our expectations. Of course, when we look at the server and the data center GPU, server did better than data center GPU. But overall, it's very consistent with our performance."
positive,0.9445771,"-- Yes. Sure, Joe. So actually, I would say that the Xilinx business has performed extremely well. The demand across all segments has been strong. And what we were able to do as we brought Xilinx into the portfolio is really make some significant improvements in the supply chain. And so we have seen a nice step up. If you were to look on a pro forma basis the Xilinx portfolio grew about 20% sequentially, which is a very nice growth. As we look into the second half of the year, we are still a bit constrained in certain areas, certain parts of the Xilinx portfolio, although we continue to make good progress, and I expect additional supply to come on, especially toward the latter part of the year and into 2023. Our view of the business, again, I think the quality of the design wins, the quality of the overall -- when you look -- the diverse market is very strong. And so I think as we are able to continue to relieve some of those supply constraints into the second half of the year, I think see a good growth trajectory for the business."
positive,0.9412211,"-- Sure, Stacy. I don't think it's a pull-forward of demand. I think what it is we wanted to see how long it would take for customers to fully qualify and get their workloads performance. So, yeah, that depends a lot on the actual engineering work that's done and now that we're, let's call it a quarter later, we've seen that it's gone really well. So, it's actually gone a bit better, then our original forecast. And as a result, we've seen stronger demand signals and customers are gaining confidence in their ability to deploy a significant number of MI300 this year."
positive,0.940896,"-- I think slightly up in the second half because the launch of product in the second half of last year started out strong because it's a new console generation. And then maybe slightly up in the second as well, I would say."
positive,0.94010675,"-- Yes, that is true. But our expectation, though is, again, we have a number of growth drivers in the business. But in terms of what has allowed us to increase the full year guide from an organic standpoint, it is a strong visibility in Server, strong visibility on the Console side, strong visibility just from an overall supply and demand perspective."
positive,0.9395887,"-- Yeah. Sure, Toshiya. Thanks for the question. So, on the supply side, let me make a couple of comments and then maybe I'll let Jean comment on sort of the trajectory for the business. So, on the supply side, we made great progress in the second quarter. We ramped up supply significantly exceeding $1 billion in the quarter. I think the team has executed really well. We continue to see line of sight to continue increasing supply as we go through the second half of the year. But I will say that the overall supply chain is tight and will remain tight through 2025. So, under that backdrop, we have great partnerships across the supply chain. We've been building additional capacity and capability there. And so, we expect to continue to ramp as we go through the year. And we'll continue to work both supply as well as demand opportunities, and really that's accelerating our customer adoption overall, and we'll see how things play out as we go into the second half of this year."
positive,0.937832,"-- Yeah. On your second question about the profitability, first, our team has done a tremendous job to ramp the product MI300. It's a very complex product so we ramped it successfully. At the same time, the team also started to implement operational optimization to continue to improve gross margin. So, we continue to see the gross margin improvement. Over time, in the longer term, we do believe gross margin will be accretive to corporate average. From a profitability perspective, AMD always invests in platforms. If you look at our data center platform, especially both the server and the data center GPU side, we are ramping the revenue. The business model can leverage very significantly even from GPU side. Because the revenue ramp has been quite significant, the operating margin continued to expand. We definitely want to continue to invest as the opportunity is huge. At the same time, it is a profitable business already."
positive,0.9377852,-- So both the mix to cloud as well as the R&D expense has increased just given the large opportunities that we have across the data center and especially AI.
positive,0.9368333,"-- Yes, Aaron. So we've said before that our goal is to ensure that we have supply that exceeds the current guidance, and that is true. So as we've upped our guidance from $3.5 billion to $4 billion, we still -- we have supply visibility significantly beyond that."
positive,0.93385226,"-- Yeah, sure, Matt. So we're pleased with the progress of our PC business. In the second quarter, we had notebook perform very well. We saw a ramp of our second-generation mobile product, and that is due to some of the additional platforms that we mentioned. Going into the second half of the year, on the desktop side, our third-generation Ryzen products are very well positioned. We expect to ramp significant production here in the third quarter. And we expect that to lead to share gains. And we're also feeling quite good about the mobile products into the second half of the year. We made progress on both consumer and commercial. We had always been strong in consumer, but on the commercial side, we have a number of new platforms as well, and those are ramping here into the second half of the year. So overall, I think the PC business continues to be a good opportunity for us to gain share through the second half of the year."
positive,0.9301857,"-- Yeah. I think it's -- I think I said earlier, but Mitch, it is certainly better. So we have better visibility a month into the quarter versus 90 days ago."
positive,0.92958134,"-- Yes. So Harlan, thanks. So we've made great progress on the cloud side, so we have strong adoption on internal, as well as external-facing workloads. We've also made strong progress on the Enterprise. I mean, as you said, all major OEMs have EPYC throughout the portfolio. And in this past quarter and in general, we've grown the Enterprise business about at the same pace as a cloud business. We're still cloud-weighted but I believe that it's going to be fairly balanced growth across both portfolios."
positive,0.92722946,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question. You are right. Our gross margin is primarily driven by our revenue mix, I think when you look at looking to 2025, Q1 guide, not only data center continued to grow significantly year over year. At the same time, client business is also growing year over year. So, overall, the revenue mix is quite consistent with the Q4. So, the gross margin guide is 54%. I think for the first half, if the revenue mix is at this level, we do feel the gross margin will be consistent with 54%. But going into second half, we do believe the data center is our fastest growth driver for the company and that will drive the gross margin to step up in second half."
positive,0.92699474,"-- I won't guide Q1, but what I'll say is from the 51% that we have in Q4, we can improve from there."
positive,0.92698306,"-- Yeah, yeah. Harlan, this is Jean. I think the server business has been performing really well year over year. It actually increased very strong double digit. I think sequentially, it is more seasonal, but we feel pretty good about continue gaining share there."
positive,0.9231122,"-- And I guess as my follow-up. So can I -- can you just give us a sense of sort of the overall profile that you see for revenue into the back half? I know you said that Data Center and Embedded will be up this year. It sounds like Data Center probably up double digits. But I also wanted to confirm that you think that total revenues also will be up this year, year over year."
