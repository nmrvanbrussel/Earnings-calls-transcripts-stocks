negative,0.96092355,"-- Got it. And then I just wanted to ask you on the Data Center business, the operating profit is down a ton sequentially. And you talked about enterprise being down, I think that's part of it. But it's a big drop, and it looks like gross margin probably is down a bunch too. Can you just comment on why that drop in profitability in Data Center?"
negative,0.96055263,"-- Got it. That's helpful. Thank you. For my second question, I wanted to look at the near-term data center profitability. So operating profit was down 19% sequentially on 2% revenue growth. Is that just the margins of the GPUs filtering in relative to the CPUs? And I know you said GPUs would eventually be above corporate average? Are they below the CPU average in -- I mean they clearly are, I guess, in the near term. But are they going to stay that way?"
negative,0.96011156,"-- So maybe -- yeah, maybe let me give you some color about the gaming business, right. It's -- if you look at the gaming, the demand has been quite weak. That's quite very well known, and also their inventory level. So based on the visibility we have, the first half, both Q1 and Q2, we guided down sequentially more than 30%. We actually think the second half will be lower than first half. That's basically how we're looking at this year for the gaming business. And at the same time, gaming's gross margin is lower than our company average. So overall, it will help the mix on the gross margin side. That's just some color on the gaming side. But you're right, Q2 gaming is down a lot."
negative,0.9524261,"-- Yeah. Sure, Blayne. So the ASPs were down quite a bit on a year-over-year basis, if you're talking about the overall Client business. And what that is, is that's also the Client ASPs were higher in the first half of '22, if you just think about what the supply environment was or the demand environment was in that. And given that we're under shipping in the first quarter, the ASPs are lower."
negative,0.9503185,"-- Yeah. Very helpful, Jean. And as a quick follow-up, I'm just curious. The traditional server demand that you see, I know when we looked at server CPU, shipments are down north of 20% year over year. Are you seeing any signals or how are you thinking about a recovery in that traditional, call it, non-AI general-purpose server market as we move through '24?"
negative,0.94895387,"-- I guess the second part -- maybe I'll ask the second part is â€“ you know, gross margins are down 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4. Mix is kind of going in your favor with Data Center and Embedded. But then I guess you're saying PCs are not down that much, so I can't -- I guess I was figuring maybe pricing is not that bad either. So, I guess that's a long way of asking, again, what's the reason for the core margins to be down 100 basis points from Q3 to Q4?"
negative,0.94872314,"-- Right. If I look at just your report versus what Intel reported on a Q-over-Q basis, it clearly on a year-over-year basis, you have gained share. But I'm just comparing down $14 million versus what you reported, and so that would imply that you had a share loss versus them unless the Data Center GPU and the Xilinx business was down significantly also on a Q-over-Q basis."
negative,0.9445982,"-- That's very helpful. And then, Lisa, as my follow-up, I had a question on profitability in your client business or your PC business. I think a year ago, margins were really high. Supply was relatively tight. Since then, with the inventory correction and perhaps a little bit more competition, your profit margins are down. You talked about the first half of this year still being sort of in digestion mode, and then in the second half, things normalizing. But would it be realistic to assume your gross margins in the client business return to first half '22 levels? Or in hindsight, margins back then were perhaps -- you were over-earning in that business given the environment?"
negative,0.9401417,-- Great. Thank you. You've talked about the embedded business declining as you move into the second half. Can you give us a sense for how much? And is that decline a function of the common infrastructure market or are you seeing weakness beyond that part of the market?
negative,0.939724,"-- So if you look at Q2, if you're asking the specific Q1 to Q2. Q2, we came in at the 46%, Q2 is down, and fundamentally primarily is due to the ramp in the game console revenue. As Lisa said earlier, we mentioned that the margins in the initial ramp of semi-custom revenue are typically lower and they do improve over time for semi-custom. But also from a company standpoint, when you look at the corporate average gross margin, it's lower. And therefore, it is having an impact in terms of sequentially the margin is going down from Q1 to Q2."
negative,0.93758816,"-- OK. And then I just want to follow up on the PC market. There's -- just you guys keep outperforming, but there's just general concerns that -- of consumer weakness. And I was just wondering what you're seeing in the 4Q and is there a risk of more than seasonal decline in the 1Q? Or do you feel like things will keep going unabated in the PC market for you guys, particularly?"
negative,0.92653984,"-- That's helpful. And then as my follow-up, a question on gross margins, maybe for Devinder. So, you're guiding Q4 gross margins up about 100 basis points, which is good to see, but you're still 300 basis points below where you were in Q2. And since then, obviously, Client is down significantly. Your Data Center business is very resilient and so is the classic Xilinx business. So, from a mix perspective, you should be in a better place. What's driving down gross margins in Q4, I guess, versus Q2? Are you recognizing another inventory hit? Or is it something else? Thank you."
negative,0.92319584,"-- No inventory hit, first of all, Toshi. On the gross margin, as you said, Q2, 54%. If you go all the way to Q4, 51% primarily is the weak PC market and Client margins coming down. For example, if you look at Q3, all other businesses were in line with expectations, and Client margins came in lower. We also have in the Data Center, a place cloud-weighted, which has lower ASPs. So, that also has an impact on margins. And then as Lisa mentioned earlier, some of the new capacity that we have from a supply standpoint, there are some additional costs from the supply capacity agreements. And those are all baked in into the Q4 51% margin guidance."
negative,0.91654336,"-- Yeah. So we are expecting that the computing and graphics business will be down sequentially. So it's offsetting some of the growth on the EPYC and semi-custom side. Within the computing and graphics business, we see notebooks up strongly, as a result of the launch of our new Ryzen 4000 platforms and some of the other trends that we've talked about. We see desktop down sequentially, and we see graphics down sequentially. Q2 is normally a sequentially down quarter for the channel business for us. So that's not unusual. And we -- that's -- those are the dynamics in the second quarter. And as we go through the second half of the year, as I mentioned, we'll have to see how consumer spending holds up against the other demand environments."
negative,0.9149807,"-- Hey, gang, thanks for sneaking me in. Just a question on gross margin. So, if we look at your guidance, it seems like the incremental gross margin is dropping a little bit for Q3. Why is that happening? And then just a follow-up on another part of the gross margin angle. Have you changed your gross margin expectations for the MI300? Has the accretion point moved out a little bit?"
negative,0.9082286,"-- Got it. And then, on the PC side and also kind of as it relates to the pricing environment, you mentioned the PC TAM is -- could be down about 10%. But when we look at the shipments, right, from you and your competitor, they could be down as much as 40% or 50%, right, year on year in Q1. So do you think there's a possibility that the TAM assumption of just down 10% could be an optimistic one? Because I would imagine that would suggest the inventory clears out soon, but you're suggesting that it may not clear out until Q2. So I was just hoping you could give us some better sense for when the PC market starts recovering? And do you think it could become more price competitive before it recovers?"
negative,0.90822387,"-- Yes. So the second quarter we saw a sequentially mobile units up, and we saw desktop units down. And the desktop units down is somewhat due to the seasonality in the second quarter as well as the fact that we were going through a product transition as we were preparing for the third-generation launch, which happened at the very end of the quarter. In terms of graphics, we were up double digits sequentially, and that's both units and revenue statement as it relates to -- and that was driven primarily by the graphics channel."
negative,0.9071378,"-- Yeah. So let me try to help you, Aaron, with that math. So look, originally, when we started the year, we thought semi-custom would be down, let's call it, approximately 20%. In the first half of the year it was down more than that. And based on what we see today, we would expect the full year now to be down, let's call it, mid-30s year-on-year. If you talk about now the rest of the business, I think the rest of the business is close to where we thought it would be, close plus or minus a couple percent. And if you think about all of the moving pieces, we do have some customers that were not shipping to -- in China. That is offset by the Samsung upside and with the new products and how they're coming in. So I think we are pretty close plus or minus to where we thought we would be ex those factors."
negative,0.90694,"-- Thanks very much. Devinder, you said the sequential decrease in the March 2020 quarter is driven primarily by the drop-in game console chips. Does that mean that you expect your microprocessor and graphics revenues will be flattish sequentially? Or if not, roughly, what does your guidance assume in terms of percentage sequential drop for, say, PC processors and GPUs? Do you get server processors sales rising sequentially?"
negative,0.90121406,"-- Yeah, Chris, I think it's a little bit early to talk about Q1. I mean I think -- let's see what would we say about seasonality. I don't have a lot to say other than typically, Q1 is down from Q4. That's typically what the pattern is, given the consumer-related businesses. It might be a little bit subseasonal as we go into this first quarter just given the demand environment, but we'll have to see how things play out over the next couple of months."
