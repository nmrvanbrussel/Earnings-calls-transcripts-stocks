# 🔍 Strategic Signaling in the Semiconductor Industry

**A game theory + NLP-based predictive analytics project to model strategic interactions among leading chip manufacturers.**

---

## ❓ Research Question
Can public communications by semiconductor firms be used to predict strategic investment decisions?

## 📘 Project Overview

This project explores how major semiconductor firms (e.g., Intel, NVIDIA, TSMC) use public communications to signal strategic intent — such as R&D investment, capacity expansion, or market entry. By combining **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **game theory**, and **machine learning**, we aim to predict firm-level decisions based on sentiment and strategic signaling.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Extract sentiment and topics from earnings call transcripts and press releases
- Model firm behavior using strategic game theory (signaling & commitment games)
- Predict outcomes such as:
  - New fab construction
  - R&D budget increases
  - AI chip market entry
- Present results in a business-strategy context for consulting-style insights

---

## 🧠 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection
- Company transcripts from **SeekingAlpha**, **Yahoo Finance**, and **IR websites**
- Financial data from **10-K filings** and **Macrotrends**
- Events: CHIPS Act news, AI chip releases, export bans

### 2. NLP Pipeline
- Sentiment analysis using `FinBERT`, `VADER`, and Hugging Face models
- Topic modeling with `BERTopic` and `LDA`
- Embedding generation via `SBERT` for clustering and similarity analysis

### 3. Game Theoretic Modeling
- **Signaling games**: Does public sentiment indicate real investment?
- **Stackelberg/R&D competition**: Leader-follower dynamics in capacity or innovation races
- **Deterrence/Commitment**: Credibility of strategic moves

### 4. Machine Learning
- Train an `XGBoost` model to classify future firm actions
- Features include sentiment scores, topic distributions, financial ratios
- Use `SHAP` for model interpretability

---

## 📊 Outputs

- Probabilistic predictions of firm decisions (e.g., "Intel 85% likely to expand fab in Q2")
- Visualizations of sentiment shifts before and after key announcements
- Game-theoretic simulations (e.g., payoff matrices and reaction strategies)
- A consulting-style recommendation slide deck (optional)
