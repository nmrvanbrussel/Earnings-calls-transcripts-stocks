NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,1,C.J. Muse,Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. I guess for me, Jensen, as test-time compute and reinforcement learning shows such promise, we're clearly seeing an increasing blurring of the lines between training and inference. What does this mean for the potential future of potentially inference dedicated clusters? And how do you think about the overall impact to NVIDIA and your customers? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,2,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, I appreciate that, C.J. There are now multiple scaling laws. There's the pre-training scaling law, and that's going to continue to scale because we have multimodality, we have data that came from reasoning that are now used to do pretraining. And then the second is post-training skilling, using reinforcement learning human feedback, reinforcement learning AI feedback, reinforcement learning, verifiable rewards. The amount of computation you use for post-training is actually higher than pretraining. And it's kind of sensible in the sense that you could, while you're using reinforcement learning, generate an enormous amount of synthetic data or synthetically generated tokens. AI models are basically generating tokens to train AI models. And that's post-trade. And the third part, this is the part that you mentioned is test-time compute or reasoning, long thinking, inference scaling. They're all basically the same ideas. And there, you have a chain of thought, you have search. The amount of tokens generated the amount of inference compute needed is already 100x more than the one-shot examples and the one-shot capabilities of large language models in the beginning. And that's just the beginning. This is just the beginning. The idea that the next generation could have thousands of times and even, hopefully, extremely thoughtful and simulation-based and search-based models that could be hundreds of thousands, millions of times more compute than today is in our future. And so, the question is, how do you design such an architecture? Some of it -- some of the models are auto-regressive. Some of the models are diffusion-based. Some of it -- some of the times you want your data center to have disaggregated inference. Sometimes, it is compacted. And so, it's hard to figure out what is the best configuration of a data center, which is the reason why NVIDIA's architecture is so popular. We run every model. We are great at training. The vast majority of our compute today is actually inference and Blackwell takes all of that to a new level. We designed Blackwell with the idea of reasoning models in mind. And when you look at training, it's many times more performing. But what's really amazing is for long thinking test time scaling, reasoning AI models were tens of times faster, 25x higher throughput. And so, Blackwell is going to be incredible across the board. And when you have a data center that allows you to configure and use your data center based on are you doing more pretraining now, post-training now, or scaling out your inference, our architecture is fungible and easy to use in all of those different ways. And so, we're seeing, in fact, much, much more concentration of a unified architecture than ever before. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,3,Joe Moore,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Morgan Stanley, actually. Thank you. I wonder if you could talk about GB200 at CES, you sort of talked about the complexity of the rack-level systems and the challenges you have. And then as you said in the prepared remarks, we've seen a lot of general availability. Where are you in terms of that ramp? Are there still bottlenecks to consider at a systems level above and beyond the chip level? And just have you maintained your enthusiasm for the NVL72 platforms?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,4,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, I'm more enthusiastic today than I was at CES. And the reason for that is because we've shipped a lot more since CES. We have some 350 plants manufacturing the 1.5 million components that go into each one of the Blackwell racks, Grace Blackwell racks. Yes, it's extremely complicated. And we successfully and incredibly ramped up Grace Blackwell, delivering some $11 billion of revenues last quarter. We're going to have to continue to scale as demand is quite high, and customers are anxious and impatient to get their Blackwell systems. You've probably seen on the web, a fair number of celebrations about Grace Blackwell systems coming online and we have them, of course. We have a fairly large installation of Grace Blackwell for our own engineering and our own design teams and software teams. CoreWeave has now been quite public about the successful bring-up of theirs. Microsoft has, of course, OpenAI has, and you're starting to see many come online. And so, I think the answer to your question is nothing is easy about what we're doing, but we're doing great, and all of our partners are doing great. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Colette if you wouldn't mind confirming if Q1 is the bottom for gross margins? And then Jensen, my question is for you. What is on your dashboard to give you the confidence that the strong demand can sustain into next year? And has DeepSeek and whatever innovations they came up with, has that changed that view in any way? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,6,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- Well, let me first take the first part of the question there regarding the gross margin. During our Blackwell ramp, our gross margins will be in the low 70s. At this point, we are focusing on expediting our manufacturing, expediting our manufacturing to make sure that we can provide to customers as soon as possible. Our Blackwell is fully round. And once it does -- I'm sorry, once our Blackwell fully rounds, we can improve our cost and our gross margin. So, we expect to probably be in the mid-70s later this year. Walking through what you heard Jensen speak about the systems and their complexity, they are customizable in some cases. They've got multiple networking options. They have liquid-cooled and water-cooled. So, we know there is an opportunity for us to improve these gross margins going forward. But right now, we are going to focus on getting the manufacturing complete and to our customers as soon as possible.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,7,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- We know several things, Vivek. We have a fairly good line of sight of the amount of capital investment that data centers are building out toward. We know that going forward, the vast majority of software is going to be based on machine learning. And so, accelerated computing and generative AI, reasoning AI are going to be the type of architecture you want in your data center. We have, of course, forecasts and plans from our top partners. And we also know that there are many innovative, really exciting start-ups that are still coming online as new opportunities for developing the next breakthroughs in AI, whether it's agentic AIs, reasoning AI, or physical AIs. The number of start-ups are still quite vibrant and each one of them needs a fair amount of computing infrastructure. And so, I think the -- whether it's the near-term signals or the midterm signals, near-term signals, of course, are POs and forecasts and things like that. Midterm signals would be the level of infrastructure and capex scale-out compared to previous years. And then the long-term signals has to do with the fact that we know fundamentally software has changed from hand-coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning and AI-based software that runs on GPUs and accelerated computing systems. And so, we have a fairly good sense that this is the future of software. And then maybe as you roll it out, another way to think about that is we've really only tapped consumer AI and search and some amount of consumer generative AI, advertising, recommenders, kind of the early days of software. The next wave is coming, agentic AI for enterprise, physical AI for robotics, and sovereign AI as different regions build out their AI for their own ecosystems. And so, each one of these are barely off the ground, and we can see them. We can see them because, obviously, we're in the center of much of this development and we can see great activity happening in all these different places and these will happen. So, near term, midterm, long term. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Harlan Sur with JPMorgan. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,8,Harlan Sur,Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. Your next-generation Blackwell Ultra is set to launch in the second half of this year, in line with the team's annual product cadence. Jensen, can you help us understand the demand dynamics for Ultra given that you'll still be ramping the current generation Blackwell solutions? How do your customers and the supply chain also manage the simultaneous ramps of these two products? And is the team still on track to execute Blackwell Ultra in the second half of this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,9,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Blackwell Ultra is second half. As you know, the first Blackwell was we had a hiccup that probably cost us a couple of months. We're fully recovered, of course. The team did an amazing job recovering and all of our supply chain partners and just so many people helped us recover at the speed of light. And so, now we've successfully ramped production of Blackwell. But that doesn't stop the next train. The next train is on an annual rhythm and Blackwell Ultra with new networking, new memories, and of course, new processors, and all of that is coming online. We have been working with all of our partners and customers, laying this out. They have all of the necessary information, and we'll work with everybody to do the proper transition. This time between Blackwell and Blackwell Ultra, the system architecture is exactly the same. It's a lot harder going from Hopper to Blackwell because we went from an NVLink 8 system to an NVLink 72-based system. So, the chassis, the architecture of the system, the hardware, the power delivery, all of that had to change. This was quite a challenging transition. But the next transition will slot right in Blackwell Ultra will slot right in. We've also already revealed and been working very closely with all of our partners on the click after that. And the click after that is called Vera Rubin and all of our partners are getting up to speed on the transition of that and so preparing for that transition. And again, we're going to provide a big, huge step-up. And so, come to GTC, and I'll talk to you about Blackwell Ultra, Vera Rubin and then show you what we place after that. Really exciting new products to come to GTC piece. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,10,Timothy Arcuri,Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. Jensen, we heard a lot about custom ASICs. Can you kind of speak to the balance between customer ASIC and merchant GPU? We hear about some of these heterogeneous superclusters to use both GPU and ASIC. Is that something customers are planning on building? Or will these infrastructures remain fairly distinct? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,11,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, we built very different things than ASICs, in some ways, completely different in some areas we intercept. We're different in several ways. One, NVIDIA'S architecture is general whether you're -- you've optimized for unaggressive models or diffusion-based models or vision-based models or multimodal models, or text models. We're great in all of it. We're great on all of it because our software stack is so -- our architecture is sensible. Our software stack ecosystem is so rich that we're the initial target of most exciting innovations and algorithms. And so, by definition, we're much, much more general than narrow. We're also really good from the end-to-end from data processing, the curation of the training data, to the training of the data, of course, to reinforcement learning used in post-training, all the way to inference with tough time scaling. So, we're general, we're end-to-end, and we're everywhere. And because we're not in just one cloud, we're in every cloud, we could be on-prem. We could be in a robot. Our architecture is much more accessible and a great target initial target for anybody who's starting up a new company. And so, we're everywhere. And the third thing I would say is that our performance in our rhythm is so incredibly fast. Remember that these data centers are always fixed in size. They're fixed in size or they're fixing power. And if our performance per watt is anywhere from 2x to 4x to 8x, which is not unusual, it translates directly to revenues. And so, if you have a 100-megawatt data center, if the performance or the throughput in that 100-megawatt or the gigawatt data center is four times or eight times higher, your revenues for that gigawatt data center is eight times higher. And the reason that is so different than data centers of the past is because AI factories are directly monetizable through its tokens generated. And so, the token throughput of our architecture being so incredibly fast is just incredibly valuable to all of the companies that are building these things for revenue generation reasons and capturing the fast ROI. And so, I think the third reason is performance. And then the last thing that I would say is the software stack is incredibly hard. Building an ASIC is no different than what we do. We build a new architecture. And the ecosystem that sits on top of our architecture is 10 times more complex today than it was two years ago. And that's fairly obvious because the amount of software that the world is building on top of architecture is growing exponentially and AI is advancing very quickly. So, bringing that whole ecosystem on top of multiple chips is hard. And so, I would say that -- those four reasons. And then finally, I will say this, just because the chip is designed doesn't mean it gets deployed. And you've seen this over and over again. There are a lot of chips that get built, but when the time comes, a business decision has to be made, and that business decision is about deploying a new engine, a new processor into a limited AI factory in size, in power, and in fine. And our technology is not only more advanced, more performance, it has much, much better software capability and very importantly, our ability to deploy is lightning fast. And so, these things are enough for the faint of heart, as everybody knows now. And so, there's a lot of different reasons why we do well, why we win. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius Research. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,12,Ben Reitzes,Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Hi. Ben Reitzes here. Hey, thanks a lot for the question. Jensen, it's a geography-related question. You did a great job explaining some of the demand underlying factors here on the strength. But U.S. was up about $5 billion or so sequentially. And I think there is a concern about whether U.S. can pick up the slack if there's regulations toward other geographies. And I was just wondering, as we go throughout the year, if this kind of surge in the U.S. continues and it's going to be -- whether that's OK. And if that underlies your growth rate, how can you keep growing so fast with this mix shift toward the U.S.? Your guidance looks like China is probably up sequentially. So, just wondering if you could go through that dynamic and maybe collect can weigh in. Thanks a lot.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,13,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- China is approximately the same percentage as Q4 and as previous quarters. It's about half of what it was before the export control. But it's approximately the same in percentage. With respect to geographies, the takeaway is that AI is software. It's modern software. It's incredible modern software, but it's modern software and AI has gone mainstream. AI is used in delivery services everywhere, shopping services everywhere. If you were to buy a quart of milk, it's delivered to you. AI was involved. And so almost everything that a consumer service provides AIs at the core of it. Every student will use AI as a tutor, healthcare services use AI, financial services use AI. No fintech company will not use AI. Every Fintech company will. Climate tech companies use AI. Mineral discovery now uses AI. The number of -- every higher education, every university uses AI and so I think it is fairly safe to say that AI has gone mainstream and that it's being integrated into every application. And our hope is that, of course, the technology continues to advance safely and advance in a helpful way to society. And with that, we're -- I do believe that we're at the beginning of this new transition. And what I mean by that in the beginning is, remember, behind us has been decades of data centers and decades of computers that have been built. And they've been built for a world of hand coding and general-purpose computing and CPUs and so on and so forth. And going forward, I think it's fairly safe to say that world is going to be almost all software to be infused with AI. All software and all services will be based on -- ultimately, based on machine learning, the data flywheel is going to be part of improving software and services and that the future computers will be accelerated, the future computers will be based on AI. And we're really two years into that journey. And in modernizing computers that have taken decades to build out. And so, I'm fairly sure that we're in the beginning of this new era. And then lastly, no technology has ever had the opportunity to address a larger part of the world's GDP than AI. No software tool ever has. And so, this is now a software tool that can address a much larger part of the world's GDP more than any time in history. And so, the way we think about growth, and the way we think about whether something is big or small has to be in the context of that. And when you take a step back and look at it from that perspective, we're really just in the beginning. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Aaron, your line is open. Your next question comes from Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI.

I had a clarification and a question. Colette up for the clarification. Did you say that enterprise within the data center grew 2x year on year for the January quarter? And if so, does that -- would that make it the fast faster growing than the hyperscalers? And then, Jensen, for you, the question, hyperscalers are the biggest purchasers of your solutions, but they buy equipment for both internal and external workloads, external workflows being cloud services that enterprise is used. So, the question is, can you give us a sense of how that hyperscaler spend splits between that external workload and internal? And as these new AI workflows and applications come up, would you expect enterprises to become a larger part of that consumption mix? And does that impact how you develop your service, your ecosystem? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,15,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- Sure. Thanks for the question regarding our Enterprise business. Yes, it grew 2x and very similar to what we were seeing with our large CSPs. Keep in mind, these are both important areas to understand. Working with the CSPs can be working on large language models, can be working on inference in their own work. But keep in mind, that is also where the enterprises are servicing. Your enterprises are both with your CSPs as well as in terms of building on their own. They're both growing quite well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,16,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The CSPs are about half of our business. And the CSPs have internal consumption and external consumption, as you say. And we're using -- of course, used for internal consumption. We work very closely with all of them to optimize workloads that are internal to them because they have a large infrastructure of NVIDIA gear that they could take advantage of. And the fact that we could be used for AI on the one hand, video processing on the other hand, data processing like Spark, we're fungible. And so, the useful life of our infrastructure is much better. If the useful life is much longer, then the TCO is also lower. And so, the second part is how do we see the growth of enterprise or not CSPs, if you will, going forward? And the answer is, I believe, long term, it is by far larger and the reason for that is because if you look at the computer industry today and what is not served by the computer industry is largely industrial. So, let me give you an example. When we say enterprise, and let's use the car company as an example because they make both soft things and hard things. And so, in the case of a car company, the employees will be what we call enterprise and agentic AI and software planning systems and tools, and we have some really exciting things to share with you guys at GTC, build agentic systems are for employees to make employees more productive to design to market plan to operate their company. That's agentic AI. On the other hand, the cars that they manufacture also need AI. They need an AI system that trains the cars, treats this entire giant fleet of cars. And today, there's 1 billion cars on the road. Someday, there will be 1 billion cars on the road, and every single one of those cars will be robotic cars, and they'll all be collecting data, and we'll be improving them using an AI factory. Whereas they have a car factory today, in the future, they'll have a car factory and an AI factory. And then inside the car itself is a robotic system. And so, as you can see, there are three computers involved and there's the computer that helps the people. There's the computer that build the AI for the machineries that could be, of course, could be a tractor, it could be a lawn mower. It could be a human or robot that's being developed today. It could be a building. It could be a warehouse. These physical systems require new type of AI we call physical AI. They can't just understand the meaning of words and languages, but they have to understand the meaning of the world, friction and inertia, object permanence, and cause and effect. And all of those type of things that are common sense to you and I, but AIs have to go learn those physical effects. So, we call that physical AI. That whole part of using agentic AI to revolutionize the way we work inside companies, that's just starting. This is now the beginning of the agentic AI era, and you hear a lot of people talking about it, and we got some really great things going on. And then there's the physical AI after that, and then there are robotic systems after that. And so, these three computers are all brand new. And my sense is that long term, this will be by far the larger of a mall, which kind of makes sense. The world's GDP is representing -- represented by either heavy industries or industrials and companies that are providing for those.

Jensen, I'm curious as we now approach the two-year anniversary of really the Hopper inflection that you saw in 2023 in GenAI in general. And when we think about the road map you have in front of us, how do you think about the infrastructure that's been deployed from a replacement cycle perspective and whether if it's GB300 or if it's the Rubin cycle where we start to see maybe some refresh opportunity? I'm just curious how you look at that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,18,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I appreciate it. First of all, people are still using Voltas and Pascals, and Amperes. And the reason for that is because there are always things that because CUDA is so programmable you could use it Blackwell, one of the major use cases right now is data processing and data curation. You find a circumstance that an AI model is not very good at. You present that circumstance to a vision language model, let's say, it's a car. You present that circumstance to a vision language model. The vision language model actually looks in the circumstances, said, this is what happened and I was very good at it. You then take that response to the prompt, and you go and prompt an AI model to go find in your whole lake of data other circumstances like that, whatever that circumstance was. And then you use an AI to do domain randomization and generate a whole bunch of other examples. And then from that, you can go train the bottle. And so, you could use an peers to go and do data processing and data curation and machine learning-based search. And then you create the training data set, which you then present to your Hopper systems for training. And so, each one of these architectures are completely -- they're all CUDA-compatible and so everything wants on everything. But if you have infrastructure in place, then you can put the less intensive workloads onto the installed base of the past. All of us are very well employed.

I have a follow-up question on gross margins for Colette. So, I understand there are many moving parts the Blackwell yields, NVLink 72, and Ethernet mix. And you kind of tipped to the earlier question the April quarter is the bottom, but second half would have to ramp like 200 basis points per quarter to get to the mid-70s range that you're giving for the end of the fiscal year. And we still don't know much about tariff impact to broader semiconductor, so what kind of gives you the confidence in that trajectory in the back half of this year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2025/02/26/nvidia-nvda-q4-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,20,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our gross margins, they're quite complex in terms of the material and everything that we put together in a Blackwell system, a tremendous amount of opportunity to look at a lot of different pieces of that on how we can better improve our gross margins over time. Remember, we have many different configurations as well on Blackwell that will be able to help us do that. So, together, working after we get some of these really strong ramping completed for our customers, we can begin a lot of that work. If not, we're going to probably start as soon as possible if we can. If we can improve it in the short term, we will also do that.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 26, 2025","December 31, 2024.",1,23,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I just wanted to thank you. Thank you, Colette. The demand for Blackwell is extraordinary. AI is evolving beyond perception and generative AI into reasoning. With resenting AI, we're observing another scaling law, inference time or test time scaling, more computation. The more the model thinks the smarter the answer. Models like OpenAI, Grok 3, DeepSeek-R1 are reasoning models that apply inference time scaling. Reasoning models can consume 100x more compute. Future reasoning models can consume much more compute. DeepSeek-R1 has ignited global enthusiasm. It's an excellent innovation. But even more importantly, it has open-sourced a world-class reasoning AI model. Nearly every AI developer is applying R1 or chain of thought and reinforcement learning techniques like R1 to scale their model's performance. We now have three scaling laws, as I mentioned earlier, driving the demand for AI computing. The traditional scaling loss of AI remains intact. Foundation models are being enhanced with multimodality, and pretraining is still growing. But it's no longer enough. We have two additional scaling dimensions: post-training scaling, where reinforcement learning, fine-tuning, model distillation require orders of magnitude more compute than pretraining alone; inference time scaling and reasoning where a single query and demand 100x more compute. We defined Blackwell for this moment, a single platform that can easily transition from pre-trading, post-training, and test time scaling. Blackwell's FP4 transformer engine and NVLink 72 scale-up fabric and new software technologies led Blackwell process reasoning AI models 25 times faster than Hopper. Blackwell in all of this configuration is in full production. Each Grace Blackwell NVLink 72 rack is an engineering marvel. 1.5 million components produced across 350 manufacturing sites by nearly 100,000 factory operators. AI is advancing at light speed. We're at the beginning of reasoning AI and inference time scaling. But we're just at the start of the age of AI, multimodal AIs, enterprise AI sovereign AI and physical AI are right around the corner. We will grow strongly in 2025. Going forward, data centers will dedicate most of capex to accelerated computing and AI. Data centers will increasingly become AI factories, and every company will have either rented or self-operated. I want to thank all of you for joining us today. Come join us at GTC in a couple of weeks. We're going to be talking about Blackwell Ultra, Rubin, and other new computing, networking, reasoning AI, physical AI products, and a whole bunch more.

I guess just a question for you on the debate around whether scaling for large language models have stalled. Obviously, we're very early here, but would love to hear your thoughts on this front. How are you helping your customers as they work through these issues? And then obviously, part of the context here is we're discussing clusters that have yet to benefit from Blackwell. So, is this driving even greater demand for Blackwell? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,2,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Our foundation model pretraining scaling is intact, and it's continuing. As you know, this is an empirical law, not a fundamental physical law. But the evidence is that it continues to scale. What we're learning, however, is that it's not enough, that we've now discovered two other ways to scale. One is post-training scaling. Of course, the first generation of post-training was reinforcement learning human feedback, but now we have reinforcement learning AI feedback, and all forms of synthetic data generated data that assists in post-training scaling. And one of the biggest events and one of the most exciting developments is Strawberry, ChatGPT o1, OpenAI's o1, which does inference time scaling, what is called test time scaling. The longer it thinks, the better and higher-quality answer it produces. And it considers approaches like chain of thought and multi-path planning and all kinds of techniques necessary to reflect and so on and so forth. And it's -- intuitively, it's a little bit like us doing thinking in our head before we answer your question. And so, we now have three ways of scaling, and we're seeing all three ways of scaling. And as a result of that, the demand for our infrastructure is really great. You see now that at the tail end of the last generation of foundation models were at about 100,000 Hoppers. The next generation starts at 100,000 Blackwells. And so, that kind of gives you a sense of where the industry is moving with respect to pretraining scaling, post-training scaling, and then now very importantly, inference time scaling. And so, the demand is really great for all of those reasons. But remember, simultaneously, we're seeing inference really starting to scale up for our company. We are the largest inference platform in the world today because our installed base is so large. And everything that was trained on Amperes and Hoppers inference incredibly on Amperes and Hoppers. And as we move to Blackwells for training foundation models, it leads behind it a large installed base of extraordinary infrastructure for inference. And so, we're seeing inference demand go up. We're seeing inference time scaling go up. We see the number of AI native companies continue to grow. And of course, we're starting to see enterprise adoption of agentic AI really is the latest rage. And so, we're seeing a lot of demand coming from a lot of different places. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Jensen, you executed the mass change earlier this year. There were some reports over the weekend about some heating issues. On the back of this, we've had investors ask about your ability to execute to the road map you presented at GTC this year with Ultra coming out next year and the transition to Rubin in '26. Can you sort of speak to that? And some investors are questioning that, so if you can sort of speak to your ability to execute on time, that would be super helpful. And then a quick part B. On supply constraints, is it a multitude of componentry that's causing this, or is it specifically HBN? Is it supply constraints? Are the supply constraints getting better? Are they worsening?

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,4,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks. So, let's see. Back to the first question. Blackwell production is in full steam. In fact, as Colette mentioned earlier, we will deliver this quarter more Blackwells than we had previously estimated. And so, the supply chain team is doing an incredible job working with our supply partners to increase Blackwell, and we're going to continue to work hard to increase Blackwell through next year. It is the case that demand exceeds our supply. And that's expected as we're in the beginnings of this generative AI revolution as we all know. And we're at the beginning of a new generation of foundation models that are able to do reasoning and able to do long thinking. And of course, one of the really exciting areas is physical AI, AI that now understands the structure of the physical world. And so, Blackwell demand is very strong. Our execution is going well. And there's obviously a lot of engineering that we're doing across the world. You see now systems that are being stood up by Dell and CoreWeave. I think you saw systems from Oracle stood up. You have systems from Microsoft, and they're about to preview their Grace Blackwell systems. You have systems that are at Google. And so, all of these CSPs are racing to be first. The engineering that we do with them is, as you know, rather complicated. And the reason for that is because, although we build full stack and full infrastructure, we disaggregate all of this AI supercomputer, and we integrate it into all of the custom data centers and architectures around the world. That integration process, it's something we've done several generations now. We're very good at it but still there's still a lot of engineering that happens at this point. But as you see from all of the systems that are being stood up, Blackwell is in great shape. And as we mentioned earlier, the supply and what we're planning to ship this quarter is greater than our previous estimates. With respect to the supply chain, there are seven different chips, seven custom chips that we built in order for us to deliver the Blackwell systems. The Blackwell systems go in air-cooled or liquid-cooled, NVLink 8 or NVLink 72 or NVLink 8, NVLink 36, NVLink 72. We have x86 or Grace. And the integration of all of those systems into the world's data centers is nothing short of a miracle. And so, the component supply chain necessary to ramp at this scale, you have to go back and take a look at how much Blackwell we shipped last quarter, which was zero. And in terms of how much Blackwell total systems will ship this quarter, which is measured in billions, the ramp is incredible. And so almost every company in the world seems to be involved in our supply chain. And we've got great partners, everybody from, of course, TSMC and Amphenol, the connector company, incredible company; Vertiv and SK Hynix and Micron; Spill Amcor; KYEC; and there's Foxconn and the factories that they've built; and Quanta and Wiwynn; and, gosh, Dell and HP, and Super Micro, Lenovo. And the number of companies is just really quite incredible. Quanta. And I'm sure I've missed partners that are involved in the ramping of Blackwell, which I really appreciate. And so, anyways, I think we're in great shape with respect to the Blackwell ramp at this point. And then lastly, your question about our execution of our road map. We're on an annual road map and we're expecting to continue to execute on our annual road map. And by doing so, we increased the performance, of course, of our platform. But it's also really important to realize that when we're able to increase performance and do so at factors at a time, we're reducing the cost of training. We're reducing the cost of inferencing. We're reducing the cost of AI so that it could be much more accessible. But the other factor that's very important to note is that when there's a data center of some fixed size and the data center always is of some fixed size. It could be, of course, tens of megawatts in the past, and now it's -- most data centers are now 100 megawatts to several hundred megawatts, and we're planning on gigawatt data centers, it doesn't really matter how large the data centers are. The power is limited. And when you're in the power-limited data center, the best -- the highest performance per watt translates directly into the highest revenues for our partners. And so, on the one hand, our annual road map reduces costs. But on the other hand, because our perf per watt is so good compared to anything out there, we generate for our customers the greatest possible revenues. And so, that annual rhythm is really important to us, and we have every intention of continuing to do that. And everything is on track as far as I know.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,5,Timothy Arcuri,Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. I'm wondering if you can talk about the trajectory of how Blackwell is going to ramp this year. I know Jensen, you did just talk about Blackwell being better than -- I think you had said several billions of dollars in January. It sounds like you're going to do more than that. But I think in recent months also, you said that Blackwell crosses over Hopper in the April quarter. So, I guess I had two questions. First of all, is that still the right way to think about it, that Blackwell will cross over Hopper in April? And then Colette, you kind of talked about Blackwell bringing down gross margin to the low 70s as it ramps. So, I guess if April is the crossover, is that the worst of the pressure on gross margin? So, you're going to be kind of in the low 70s as soon as April. I'm just wondering if you can sort of shape that for us. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,7,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- Sure. Let me first start with your question, Tim, thank you, regarding our gross margins. And we discussed that our gross margins, as we are ramping Blackwell in the very beginning, and the many different configurations, the many different chips that we are bringing to market, we are going to focus on making sure we have the best experience for our customers as they stand that up. We will start growing into our gross margins, but we do believe those will be in the low 70s in that first program. So, you're correct, as you look at the quarters following after that, we will start increasing our gross margins, and we hope to get to the mid-70s quite quickly as part of that round.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Hopper demand will continue through next year, surely the first several quarters of the next year. And meanwhile, we will ship more Blackwells next quarter than this, and we'll ship more Blackwells the quarter after that than our first quarter. And so, that kind of puts it in perspective. We are really at the beginnings of two fundamental shifts in computing that is really quite significant. The first is moving from coding that runs on CPUs to machine learning that creates neural networks that runs on GPUs. And that fundamental shift from coding to machine learning is widespread at this point. There are no companies who are not going to do machine learning. And so, machine learning is also what enables generative AI. And so, on the one hand, the first thing that's happening is $1 trillion worth of computing systems and data centers around the world is now being modernized for machine learning. On the other hand, secondarily, I guess, is that on top of these systems are going to be -- we're going to be creating a new type of capability called AI. And when we say generative AI, we're essentially saying that these data centers are really AI factories. They're generating something. Just like we generate electricity, we're now going to be generating AI. And if the number of customers is large, just as the number of consumers of electricity is large, these generators are going to be running 24/7. And today, many AI services are running 24/7, just like an AI factory. And so, we're going to see this new type of system come online, and I call it an AI factory because that's really as close to what it is. It's unlike a data center of the past. And so, these two fundamental trends are really just beginning. And so, we expect this to happen, this growth, this modernization, and the creation of a new industry to go on for several years.

Colette, just to clarify, do you think it's a fair assumption to think NVIDIA could recover to kind of mid-70s gross margin in the back half of calendar '25? Just wanted to clarify that. And then Jensen, my main question, historically, when we have seen hardware deployment cycles, they have inevitably included some digestion along the way. When do you think we get to that phase? Or is it just too premature to discuss that because you're just at the start of Blackwell? So, how many quarters of shipments do you think is required to kind of satisfy this first wave? Can you continue to grow this into calendar '26? Just how should we be prepared to see what we have seen historically, right, a period of digestion along the way of a long-term kind of secular hardware deployment?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/

Vivek, thank you for the question. Let me clarify your question regarding gross margins. Could we reach the mid-70s in the second half of next year? And yes, I think it is a reasonable assumption or goal for us to do, but we'll just have to see how that mix of ramp goes. But yes, it is definitely possible.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,11,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The way to think through that, Vivek, is I believe that there will be no digestion until we modernize $1 trillion with the data centers. Those -- if you just look at the world's data centers, the vast majority of it is built for a time when we wrote applications by hand and we ran them on CPUs. It's just not a sensible thing to do anymore. If you have -- if every company's capex -- if they're ready to build data center tomorrow, they ought to build it for a future of machine learning and generative AI because they have plenty of old data centers. And so, what's going to happen over the course of the next X number of years, and let's assume that over the course of four years, the world's data centers could be modernized as we grow into IT, as you know, IT continues to grow about 20%, 30% a year, let's say. But let's say by 2030, the world's data centers for computing is, call it, a couple of trillion dollars. We have to grow into that. We have to modernize the data center from coding to machine learning. That's number one. The second part of it is generative AI. And we're now producing a new type of capability the world's never known, a new market segment that the world's never had. If you look at OpenAI, it didn't replace anything. It's something that's completely brand new. It's, in a lot of ways as when the iPhone came, was completely brand new. It wasn't really replacing anything. And so, we're going to see more and more companies like that. And they're going to create and generate, out of their services, essentially intelligence. Some of it would be digital artist intelligence like Runway. Some of it would be basic intelligence like OpenAI. Some of it would be legal intelligence like Harvey, digital marketing intelligence like Rider's, so on and so forth. And the number of these companies, these -- what are they called, AI-native companies, are just in hundreds. And almost every platform shift, there was -- there were Internet companies, as you recall. There were cloud-first companies. There were mobile-first companies. Now, they're AI natives. And so, these companies are being created because people see that there's a platform shift, and there's a brand-new opportunity to do something completely new. And so, my sense is that we're going to continue to build out to modernize IT, modernize computing, number one; and then number two, create these AI factories that are going to be for a new industry for the production of artificial intelligence.

Colette, I had a clarification and a question for you. The clarification, just when you say low 70s gross margins, does 73.5% count as low 70s, or do you have something else in mind? And for my question, you're guiding total revenues, and so I mean, total data center revenues in the next quarter must be up several billion dollars. But it sounds like Blackwell now should be up more than that. But you also said Hopper was still strong, so like is Hopper down sequentially next quarter? And if it is, like why? Is it because of the supply constraints? China has been pretty strong. Is China is kind of rolling off a bit into Q4? So any color you can give us on sort of the Blackwell ramp and the Blackwell versus Hopper behavior into Q4 would be really helpful.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,13,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- So, first, starting on your first question there, Stacy, regarding our gross margin and define low. Low, of course, is below the mids, and let's say we might be at 71%, maybe about 72%, 72.5%. We're going to be in that range. We could be higher than that as well. We're just going to have to see how it comes through. We do want to make sure that we are ramping and continuing that improvement, the improvement in terms of our yields, the improvement in terms of the product as we go through the rest of the year, so we'll get up to the mid-70s by that point. The second statement was a question regarding our Hopper and what is our Hopper doing. We have seen substantial growth for H200 not only in terms of orders but the quickness in terms of those that are standing that out. It is an amazing product and it's the fastest growing and ramping that we've seen. We will continue to be selling Hopper in this quarter, in Q4 for sure. That is across the board in terms of all of our different configurations, and our configurations include what we may do in terms of China. But keep that in mind that folks are also, at the same time, looking to build out their Blackwell. So, we've got a little bit of both happening in Q4. But yes. Is it possible for Hopper to grow between Q3 and Q4? It's possible, but we'll just have to see. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore of Morgan Stanley.

I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you're seeing in the inference market. You've talked about Strawberry and some of the ramifications of longer scaling influence projects. But you've also talked about the possibility that as some of these Hopper clusters age, that you could use some of the Hopper chips for inference. So, I guess do you expect inference to outgrow training in the next kind of 12 months time frame? And just generally, your thoughts there.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,15,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Our hopes and dreams is that someday, the world does a ton of inference. And that's when AI has really exceeded is when every single company is doing inference inside their companies for the marketing department and forecasting department and supply chain group and their legal department and engineering, of course, and coding of course. And so, we hope that every company is doing inference 24/7 and that there will be a whole bunch of AI native start-ups, thousands of AI native start-ups that are generating tokens and generating AI. And every aspect of your computer experience from using Outlook to PowerPointing or when you're sitting there with Excel, you're constantly generating tokens. And every time you read a PDF, open a PDF, it generated a whole bunch of tokens. One of my favorite applications is NotebookLM, this Google application that came out. I used the living daylights out of it just because it's fun. And I put every PDF, every archived paper into it just to listen to it as well as scanning through it. And so, I think that's the goal is to train these models so that people use it. And there's now a whole new era of AI, if you will, a whole new genre of AI called physical AI. Just those large language models understand the human language and how the thinking process, if you will. Physical AI understands the physical world. And it understands the meaning of the structure and understands what's sensible and what's not and what could happen and what won't. And not only does it understand but it can predict, roll out a short future. That capability is incredibly valuable for industrial AI and robotics. And so, that's fired up so many AI-native companies and robotics companies and physical AI companies that you're probably hearing about. And it's really the reason why we built Omniverse. Omniverse is -- so that we can enable these AIs to be created and learn in Omniverse and learn from synthetic data generation and reinforcement, learning physics feedback. Instead of just a human feedback, it's now physics feedback. To have these capabilities, Omniverse was created so that we can enable physical AI. And so, that -- the goal is to generate tokens. The goal is to inference, and we're starting to see that growth happening. So, I'm super excited about that. Now, let me just say one more thing. Inference is super hard. And the reason why inference is super hard is because you need the accuracy to be high on the one hand. You need the throughput to be high so that the cost could be as low as possible, but you also need the latency to be low. And computers that are high-throughput as well as low latency is incredibly hard to build. And these applications have long context lengths because they want to understand. They want to be able to inference within understanding the context of what they're being asked to do. And so, the context length is growing larger and larger. On the other hand, the models are getting larger. They're multimodality. Just the number of dimensions that inference is innovating is incredible. And this innovation rate is what makes NVIDIA's architecture so great because we -- our ecosystem is fantastic. Everybody knows that if they innovate on top of CUDA and top of NVIDIA's architecture, they can innovate more quickly and they know that everything should work. And if something were to happen, it's probably likely their code and not ours. And so, that ability to innovate in every single direction at the same time, having a large installed base so that whatever you create could land on an NVIDIA computer and be deployed broadly all around the world in every single data center all the way out to the edge into robotic systems, that capability is really quite phenomenal.

And our focus since the beginning of our acquisition of Mellanox has really been about building together the work that we do in terms of in the data center. The networking is such a critical part of that. Our ability to sell our networking with many of our systems that we are doing in data center is continuing to grow and do quite well. So, this quarter is just a slight dip down and we're going to be right back up in terms of growing. We're getting ready for Blackwell and more and more systems that will be using not only our existing networking but also the networking that is going to be incorporated in a lot of these large systems we are providing them to.

Colette, on the last earnings call, you mentioned that sovereign demand is in low double-digit billions. Can you provide an update on that? And then can you explain the supply constrained situation in gaming?

Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- So, first, starting in terms of sovereign AI, such an important part of growth, something that is really surfaced with the onset of generative AI and building models in the individual countries around the world. And we see a lot of them, and we talked about a lot of them on the call today and the work that they are doing. So, our sovereign AI and our pipeline going forward is still absolutely intact as those are working to build these foundational models in their own language, in their own culture, and working in terms of the enterprises within those countries. And I think you'll continue to see this be growth opportunities that you may see with our regional clouds that are being stood up and/or those that are focusing in terms of AI factories for many parts of the sovereign AI. This is areas where this is growing not only in terms of in Europe, but you're also seeing this in terms of growth in terms of in the Asia Pac as well. Let me flip to your second question that you asked regarding Gaming. So, our Gaming right now from a supply, we're busy trying to make sure that we can ramp all of our different products. And in this case, our gaming supply, given what we saw selling through was moving quite fast. Now, the challenge that we have is how fast could we get that supply getting ready into the market for this quarter. Not to worry, I think we'll be back on track with more supply as we turn the corner into the new calendar year. We're just going to be tight for this quarter.

I wanted to ask Colette and Jensen with regard to sequential growth. So, very strong sequential growth this quarter, and you're guiding to about 7%. Do your comments on Blackwell imply that we reaccelerate from there as you get more supply just in the first half, there would be some catch-up. So, I was wondering how prescriptive you could be there. And then, Jensen, just overall with the change in administration that's going to take place here in the U.S. and the China situation, have you gotten any sense or any conversations about tariffs or anything with regard to your China business?

Jensen, you mentioned in your comments, you have the pretraining, the actual language models and you have reinforcement learning that becomes more and more important in training and inference as well and then you have inference itself. And I was wondering if you have a sense like a high-level typical sense of out of an overall AI ecosystem, like maybe one of your clients or one of the large models that are out there today, how much of the compute goes into each of these buckets? How much for the pretraining? How much for the reinforcement? And how much into inference today? Do you have any sense for how it's splitting and where the growth is the most important as well?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-q3-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,25,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, today, it's vastly in pretraining a foundation model because, as you know, post-training, the new technologies are just coming online. And whatever you could do in pretraining and post-training, you would try to do so that the inference cost could be as low as possible for everyone. However, there are only so many things that you could do a priority. And so, you'll always have to do on-the-spot thinking and in-context thinking and reflection. And so, I think that the fact that all three are scaling is actually very sensible based on where we are. And in the area foundation model, now we have multimodality foundation models, and the amount of petabytes video that these foundation models are going to be trained on, it's incredible. And so, my expectation is that for the foreseeable future, we're going to be scaling pretraining, post-training, as well as inference time scaling and which is the reason why I think we're going to need more and more compute. And we're going to have to drive as hard as we can to keep increasing the performance by X factors out of time so that we can continue to drive down the cost and continue to increase the revenues and get the AI revolution going.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 20, 2024","September 30, 2024.",1,26,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thank you. The tremendous growth in our business is being fueled by two fundamental trends that are driving global adoption of NVIDIA computing. First, the computing stack is undergoing a reinvention, a platform shift from coding to machine learning, from executing code on CPUs to processing neural networks on GPUs. The $1 trillion installed base of traditional data center infrastructure is being rebuilt for Software 2.0, which applies machine learning to produce AI. Second, the age of AI is in full steam. Generative AI is not just a new software capability but a new industry with AI factories manufacturing digital intelligence, a new industrial revolution that can create a multi-trillion-dollar AI industry. Demand for Hopper and anticipation for Blackwell, which is now in full production, are incredible for several reasons. There are more foundation model makers now than there were a year ago. The computing scale of pretraining and post-training continues to grow exponentially. There are more AI-native start-ups than ever, and the number of successful inference services is rising. And with the introduction of ChatGPT o1, OpenAI o1, a new scaling law called test time scaling has emerged. All of these consume a great deal of computing. AI is transforming every industry, company, and country. Enterprises are adopting agentic AI to revolutionize workflows. Over time, AI coworkers will assist employees in performing their jobs faster and better. Investments in industrial robotics are surging due to breakthroughs in physical AI, driving new training infrastructure demand as researchers train world foundation models on petabytes of video and Omniverse synthetically generated data. The age of robotics is coming. Countries across the world recognize the fundamental AI trends we are seeing and have awakened to the importance of developing their national AI infrastructure. The age of AI is upon us, and it's large and diverse. NVIDIA's expertise, scale, and ability to deliver full stack and full infrastructure lets us serve the entire multitrillion-dollar AI and robotics opportunities ahead from every hyperscale cloud, enterprise private cloud to sovereign regional AI clouds, on-prem to industrial edge and robotics.

Internally at NVIDIA, like what are you guys watching? What's on your dashboard as you try to gauge customer return and how that impacts capex? And then a quick follow-up maybe for Colette.

Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,4,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, Toshiya. First of all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out, I don't mean starting to ship, but I mean -- I don't mean starting production but shipping up. On the longer-term question, let's take a step back. And you've heard me say that we're going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time. The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to -- from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling has been known to be slowing for some time and it has slowed to a crawl. And yet the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so, if we don't have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around the world. In fact, you're seeing that. And so, the answer is accelerated computing. We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific simulations or database processing, but what that translates directly to is lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there's a blog that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer. And that's really the core of the first platform transition, going from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it's not unusual to see someone save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multitrillion-parameter models and train it on -- pretrain it on just about the world's knowledge corpus and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning, and so which caused the generative AI revolution. Now, generative AI, taking a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it is because it's not just a feature, it's not just the capability. It's a fundamental new way of doing software. Instead of human-engineered algorithms, we now have data. We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer what are the expected answers. What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what the algorithm is, what's the function. It learns a universal -- AI is a bit of a universal function approximator and it learns the function. And so, you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have that's predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous examples of. And so, now here we are with generative AI. It's a fundamental new form of computer science. It's affecting how every layer of computing is done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms, and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI. So, the first thing that's happening is the frontier models are growing in quite substantial scale. And they're still seeing -- we're still all seeing the benefits of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so, the amount of flops necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so, it's not unexpected to see that the next-generation models could take 10, 20, 40 times more compute than last generation. So, we have to continue to drive the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. And so, the first one is there are larger frontier models trained on more modalities. And surprisingly, there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so, you have more and more and more. That's one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second is although it's below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are ChatGPT image generators. We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What's below the iceberg are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which are -- and you've heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender systems moving from CPUs. It's now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So, recommender systems, ad generation, custom ad generation targeting ads at very large scale and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content, these are all very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course, the number of generative AI start-ups is generating tens of billions of dollars of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier, is starting, and you might have seen our announcement that the world's leading IT companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform to the world's enterprises. The companies that we're talking to, so many of them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of the company. And then general robotics. The big transformation last year as we are able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse, we are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start thinking about, start building general robotics. And so, you can see that there are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so, we're actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/

Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- And Toshiya, to answer your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to have their own generative AI that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country.

Jensen, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell anticipation being incredible. But it seems like Hopper demand is also really strong. I mean, you're guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell in October. So, how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters? Just some sense of what that transition looks like.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,7,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Joe. The demand for Hopper is really strong. And it's true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible. There's a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look at the world's cloud service providers, the amount of GPU capacity they have available, it's basically none. And the reason for that is because they're either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data processing, for example. Data processing, we hardly ever talk about it because it's mundane. It's not very cool because it doesn't generate a picture or generate words. But almost every single company in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA's GPUs are the only accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Panda's data, data science toolkits like Panda's, and the new one, Polar's. These are the ones -- the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs, which as I've mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA's accelerated computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And so, number one is the primary -- the No. 1 use case long before generative AI came along is that the migration of applications one after another to accelerated computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. They're renting capacity to model makers. They're renting it to start-up companies. And a generative AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so, these companies need it now. They just simply can't afford -- you just raise money. They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do. You can't do it next year, you got to do it today. And so, there's a fair -- that's one reason. The second reason for Hopper demand right now is because of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to be -- get to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. The second person who gets there is incrementally better or about the same. And so, the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and be the first one there is how you establish leadership. NVIDIA is constantly doing that, and we show that to the world and the GPUs we make and the AI factories that we make, the networking systems that we make, the SoCs we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world's best. And that's the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society, we want to see all that come true. And so, these model makers are the same. Of course, they want to be the world's best. They want to be the world's first. And although Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or so away. And so, between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic. And so, everybody is just really in a hurry. It's either operational reasons that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don't want to build any more general-purpose computing infrastructure and even Hopper. Of course, H200 is state-of-the-art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so, I think people are just clamoring to transition the $1 trillion of established installed infrastructure to a modern infrastructure and Hopper's state-of-the-art.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,8,Matt Ramsay,Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everybody. Jensen, I wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of this capex. And hopefully, this question and the distinction will make some sense. But what I'm having discussions about is with like the percentage of folks that you see that are spending all of this money and looking to sort of push the frontier toward AGI convergence and, as you just said, a new plateau in capability, and they're going to spend regardless to get to that level of capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their company versus customers that are really, really focused today on capex versus ROI. I don't know if that distinction makes sense. I'm just trying to get a sense of how you're seeing the priorities of people that are putting the dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and their time frames are for that investment. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,9,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, Matt. The people who are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away. It's the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can make today. And so, one way to think through it, probably the most -- the easiest way to think through it is just go back to first principles. You have $1 trillion worth of general-purpose computing infrastructure. And the question is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every $1 billion worth of Juniper CPU-based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent it for less than $1 billion. And so, because it's commoditized, there's already $1 trillion on the ground. What's the point of getting more? And so, the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon, Blackwell-based infrastructure, they start saving money. That's a tremendous return on investment. And the reason why they start saving money is because data processing saves money, and data processing is probably just a giant part of it already. And so, recommender systems save money, so on and so forth, OK? And so, you start saving money. The second thing is everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are being founded to create generative AI. And so, your capacity gets rented right away and the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third reason is your own business. Do you want to either create the next frontier yourself or your own Internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system? So, for your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content, social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast ROI. And so, there's a lot of ways you could think through it. But at the core, it's because it is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground today. The world of general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing. The world of human-engineered software is moving to generative AI software. If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers, build it with accelerated computing NVIDIA. That's the best way to do it.

I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth, both near and longer term. I know Colette, you did increase opex for the year. And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations, that's also quite bullish. On the other hand, there's some school of thought that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling, and I do recognize that some of these racks can be air-cooled. But Jensen, is that something to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great year and you look into '26, do you worry about any other gating factors like, say, the power supply chain or at some point, models start to get smaller?

I really appreciate the question, Tim. So, remember, the world is moving from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about $1 trillion worth of data centers. $1 trillion worth of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past, no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear: because we need to accelerate workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don't experience computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative AI that we could all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future of computing. And so, I think working backwards, the way to think about that is the next $1 trillion of the world's infrastructure will clearly be different than the last $1 trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor that we pioneered with Volta. And I think it was Volta. And so, we've been shipping the HGX form factor for some time. It is air-cooled. The Grace Blackwell is liquid-cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go to liquid-cooled is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid-cooled data center, in any data center -- power-limited data center, whatever size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. And so, liquid cooling is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better, and liquid cooling allows you to have the benefit of this capability we call NVLink, which allows us to expand it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so, imagine 144 GPUs connected in NVLink. And that, we're increasingly showing you the benefits of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput large language model inference, and the large NVLink domain is going to be a game changer for that. And so, I think people are very comfortable deploying both. And so, almost every CSP we're working with are deploying some of both. And so, I'm pretty confident that we'll ramp it up just fine. Your second question out of the third is that looking forward, yes, next year is going to be a great year. We expect to grow our Data Center business quite significantly next year. Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two platform transitions at the same time. And that's just really, really important to keep your head on -- your mind focused on, which is general-purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing, and human-engineered software is going to transition to generative AI or artificial intelligence-learned software. OK. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,12,Stacy Rasgon,Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. So, I have two short questions for Colette. The first several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half. Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins. If I have mid-70s for the year, let's say, where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for the year, I'd be something like 71 to 72 for Q4, somewhere in that range. Is that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you're expecting? And how should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution into next year as Blackwell ramps? And I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory reserves and everything come up.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,13,Colette M. Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- So, Stacy, let's first take your question that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So, we believe our Hopper will continue to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing products for Hopper that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So, let's say, Hopper there for versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally, we have the Blackwell on top of that, and the Blackwell starting ramping in Q4. So, I hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in terms of our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We'll work with all the different transitions that we're going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in Q3. We provided that we're still on track for the full year also in the mid-70s or approximately the 75. So, we're going to see some slight difference possibly in Q4, again with our transitions and the different cost structures that we have on our new product introductions. However, I'm not in the same number that you are there. We don't have exactly guidance, but I do believe you're lower than where we are. Operator And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes with Melius.

I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10-Q that came out, and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there. And obviously, China did very well. You mentioned it in your remarks. What are the puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy's question if that means the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company accelerate in the fourth quarter, given all those favorable revenue dynamics. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/

Kress,"Chief Financial Officer, Executive Vice President",company,"-- Let me talk about a bit in terms of our disclosure in terms of the 10-Q, a required disclosure in a choice of geographies. Very challenging sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key piece. The pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and/or specifically who we invoice to, and so what you're seeing in terms of there is who we invoice. That's not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may even travel to the end customer. These are just moving to our OEMs or ODMs and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So, what you're seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there are invoicing to China. Keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also Data Center, also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement and regarding gross margin and also what we're seeing in terms of what we're looking at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow in the second half. We'll continue to grow from what we are currently seeing. Determining that exact mix in each Q3 and Q4, we don't have here. We are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture. Operator And your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.

You've embarked on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming more and more, given rising complexity in a rather limit advanced package world.

Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks. Let's see. I think the first answer to your -- the answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want to continue to drive its cost down. It's growing so we want to continue to increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models, that we'll reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up, realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so, we're going to drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability, fairly uniquely, to integrate, to design an AI factory because we have all the parts. It's not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless you have all the parts. And so, we have -- next year, we're going to ship a lot more CPUs than we've ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but also NVLink switches, CX DPUs, ConnectX for East and West, BlueField DPUs for North and South, and data and storage processing to InfiniBand for supercomputing centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand-new product for us, which is well on its way to becoming a multibillion-dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet. And so, the fact that we could build -- we have access to all of this, we have one architectural stack, as you know, it allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find customers to sell it to, and then you've got to build -- somebody's got to build up an AI factory, and the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so, it's not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is disintegrated in the sense that we could service Quanta, Foxconn, HP, Dell, Lenovo, Super Micro. We used to be able to serve ZTE. They were recently purchased and so on and so forth. And so, the number of ecosystem partners that we have, Gigabyte, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrated in a bespoke way into all of the world's cloud service providers, enterprise data centers, the scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrators, integrated supply chain, is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so, that part, we don't want to do and we're not good at doing. And -- but we know how to design the AI infrastructure, provided the way that customers would like it and lets the ecosystem integrate it. Well, yes. So, anyways, that's the reason why. Operator And your final question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,18,Aaron Rakers,Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink, you think about GB NVL72 and how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell product cycle. I guess to put it simply, how do you see that mix of rack scale systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,19,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Aaron, thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it's designed and architected as a rack but it's sold in disaggregated system components. We don't sell the whole rack. And the reason for that is because everybody's rack's a little different surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different. Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration into people's data centers, all different. And so, the way we designed it, we architected the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack. And then we provide the system components. Like for example, the CPU and GPU compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It's a modular system architecture. MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all over the plant. And so, just about any configuration you would like, where you would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it's got to be close to. It has to be integrated and assembled close to the data center because it's fairly heavy. And so everything from the supply chain from the moment that we ship the GPU, CPUs, the switches, the NICs, from that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so, you can imagine how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we've scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so, I think because we show it as one rack and because it's always rendered that way and shown that way, we might have left the impression that we're doing the integration. Our customers hate that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want to do the integration. That's their value-add. There's a final design-in, if you will. It's not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center but the design fit-in is really complicated. And so, the design fit-in, the installation, the bring-up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this incredibly well. So, integration is not the reason why we're doing racks. It's the anti-reason of doing it. The way we don't want to be an integrator, we want to be a technology provider. Operator And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/28/nvidia-nvda-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 28, 2024","June 30, 2024.",1,20,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thank you. Let me make a couple more -- make a couple of comments that I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper demand remains strong and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated computing has reached the tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDA-X libraries. New libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including CUDA-X Accelerated Polars, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data processing libraries, CUVI-S for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right now. Ariel and for 5G wireless base station, a whole suite of a whole world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing and AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We are at the beginning of our journey to modernize $1 trillion worth of data centers from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's number one. Number two, Blackwall is a step-function leap over Hopper. Blackwell is an AI infrastructure platform, not just the GPU. Also happens to be the name of our GPU but it's an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell's lead becomes clear. The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind chips to realize, the Gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU, and a colos package, ConnectX DPU for East-West traffic, BlueField DPU for North-South and storage traffic, NVLink switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum-X for both InfiniBand and Ethernet can support the massive traffic of AI. Blackwell AI factories are building-size computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized the Blackwell platform, full stack end to end, from chips, systems, networking, even structured cables, power and cooling, and mounds of software to make it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive infrastructures. Customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper. The third is NVLink. This is a very big deal with its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing. The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72 GB200 packages into one NVLink domain, with an aggregate NVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second in one rack. Just to put that in perspective, that's about 10x higher than Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost the training of multitrillion-parameter models on trillions of tokens. And so, that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For inference, NVLink is vital for low-latency, high-throughput large language model token generation. We now have three networking platforms, NVLink for GPU scale-up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories, and Spectrum-X for AI on Ethernet. NVIDIA's networking footprint is much bigger than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety and IQ. We're also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images, and video to 3D physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and image generators are growing fast but it's just the tip of the iceberg. Internet services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting, and search systems. AI start-ups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly of CSP's cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA AI, NVIDIA Omniverse is opening up the next era of AI, general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has started, and we're poised to help companies transform their businesses. The NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform consists of Nemo, NIMs, NIM Agent Blueprints, and AI Foundry that our ecosystem partners, the world-leading IT companies used to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications. Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise run time, and at $4,500 per GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI anywhere. And for NVIDIA software, TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible GPU installed base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned, NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for joining us today.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,5,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. I wanted to ask, Jensen, about the deployment of Blackwell versus Hopper just given the system's nature and all the demand for GB that you have. How does the deployment of this stuff differ from Hopper? I guess I ask because liquid cooling at scale hasn't been done before, and there's some engineering challenges both at the node level and within the data center. So, do these complexities sort of elongate the transition? And how do you sort of think about how that's all going? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,6,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Yep. Blackwell comes in many configurations. Blackwell is a platform, not a GPU. And the platform includes support for air-cooled, liquid-cooled, x86 and Grace, InfiniBand, now Spectrum-X, and very large NVLink domain that I demonstrated at GTC -- that I showed at GTC. And so, for some customers, they will ramp into their existing installed base of data centers that are already shipping Hoppers. They will easily transition from H100 to H200 to B100. And so, Blackwell systems have been designed to be backwards compatible, if you will, electrically, mechanically. And of course, the software stack that runs on Hopper will run fantastically on Blackwell. We also have been priming the pump, if you will, with the entire ecosystem, getting them ready for liquid cooling. We've been talking to the ecosystem about Blackwell for quite some time. And the CSPs, the data centers, the ODMs, the system makers, our supply chain; beyond them, the cooling supply chain base, liquid cooling supply chain base, data center supply chain base, no one is going to be surprised with Blackwell coming and the capabilities that we would like to deliver with Grace Blackwell 200. GB200 is going to be exceptional. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities.

Jensen, how are you ensuring that there is enough utilization of your products and that there isn't a pull ahead or a holding behavior because of tight supply, competition, or other factors? Basically, what checks have you built in the system to give us confidence that monetization is keeping pace with your really very strong shipment growth?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Well, I guess there's the big picture view that I'll come to, but I'll answer your question directly. The demand for GPUs in all the data centers is incredible. We're racing every single day. And the reason for that is because applications like ChatGPT and GPT-4o, and now, it's going to be multi-modality, Gemini and its ramp and Anthropic, and all of the work that's being done at all the CSPs are consuming every GPU that's out there. There's also a long line of generative AI start-ups, some 15,000, 20,000 start-ups that are in all different fields, from multimedia to digital characters, of course, all kinds of design tool application, productivity applications, digital biology, the moving of the AV industry to video so that they can train end-to-end models to expand the operating domain of self-driving cars, the list is just quite extraordinary. We're racing actually. Customers are putting a lot of pressure on us to deliver the systems and stand those up as quickly as possible. And of course, I haven't even mentioned all of the sovereign AIs who would like to train all of their regional natural resource of their country, which is their data, to train their regional models. And there's a lot of pressure to stand those systems up. So, anyhow, the demand, I think, is really, really high and it outstrips our supply. That's the reason why I jumped in to make a few comments. Longer term, we're completely redesigning how computers work. And this is a platform shift. Of course, it's been compared to other platform shifts in the past. But time will clearly tell that this is much, much more profound than previous platform shifts. And the reason for that is because the computer is no longer an instruction-driven-only computer. It's an intention-understanding computer. And it understands, of course, the way we interact with it, but it also understands our meaning, what we intend that we asked it to do. And it has the ability to reason, inference iteratively to process a plan, and come back with a solution. And so, every aspect of the computer is changing in such a way that instead of retrieving prerecorded files, it is now generating contextually relevant intelligent answers. And so, that's going to change computing stacks all over the world. And you saw a build that, in fact, even the PC computing stack is going to get revolutionized. And this is just the beginning of all the things that -- what people see today are the beginning of the things that we're working in our labs and the things that we're doing with all the start-ups and large companies and developers all over the world. It's going to be quite extraordinary. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley.

Understanding what you just said about how strong demand is, you have a lot of demand for H200 and for Blackwell products. Do you anticipate any kind of pause with Hopper and H100 as you sort of migrate to those products? Will people wait for those new products, which would be a good product to have? Or do you think there's enough demand for H100 to sustain growth?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,10,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- We see increasing demand of Hopper through this quarter. And we expect demand to outstrip supply for some time as we now transition to H200, as we transition to Blackwell. Everybody is anxious to get their infrastructure online.

First, NVIDIA's accelerated computing architecture allows customers to process every aspect of their pipeline from unstructured data processing to prepare it for training, to structured data processing, data frame processing like SQL to prepare for training, to training to inference. And as I was mentioning in my remarks, that inference has really fundamentally changed, it's now generation. It's not trying to just detect the cat, which was plenty hard in itself, but it has to generate every pixel of a cat. And so, the generation process is a fundamentally different processing architecture. And it's one of the reasons why TensorRT-LLM was so well received. We improved the performance in using the same chips on our architecture by a factor of three. That kind of tells you something about the richness of our architecture and the richness of our software. So, one, you could use NVIDIA for everything, from computer vision to image processing, to computer graphics, to all modalities of computing. And as the world is now suffering from computing cost and computing energy inflation because general-purpose computing has run its course, accelerated computing is really the sustainable way of going forward. So, accelerated computing is how you're going to save money in computing, is how you're going to save energy in computing. And so, the versatility of our platform results in the lowest TCO for their data centers. Second, we're in every cloud. And so, for developers that are looking for a platform to develop on, starting with NVIDIA is always a great choice. And we're on-prem. We're in the cloud. We're in computers of any size and shape. We're practically everywhere. And so, that's the second reason. The third reason has to do with the fact that we build AI factories. And this is becoming more apparent to people that AI is not a chip problem only. It starts, of course, with very good chips and we build a whole bunch of chips for our AI factories, but it's a systems problem. In fact, even AI is now a systems problem. It's not just one large language model. It's a complex system of a whole bunch of large language models that are working together. And so, the fact that NVIDIA builds this system causes us to optimize all of our chips to work together as a system, to be able to have software that operates as a system, and to be able to optimize across the system. And just to put it in perspective, in simple numbers, if you had a $5 billion infrastructure and you improved the performance by a factor of two, which we routinely do, when you improve the infrastructure by a factor of two, the value to you is $5 billion. All the chips in that data center doesn't pay for it. And so, the value of it is really quite extraordinary. And this is the reason why today, performance matters in everything. This is at a time when the highest performance is also the lowest cost because the infrastructure cost of carrying all of these chips cost a lot of money. And it takes a lot of money to fund the data center, to operate the data center, the people that goes along with it, the power that goes along with it, the real estate that goes along with it, and all of it adds up. And so, the highest performance is also the lowest TCO. Operator Our next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,13,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good afternoon, everyone. Jensen, I've been in the data center industry my whole career. I've never seen the velocity that you guys are introducing new platforms at the same combination of the performance jumps that you're getting, I mean, 5x in training, some of the stuff you talked about at GTC up to 30x in inference. And it's an amazing thing to watch but it also creates an interesting juxtaposition where the current generation of product that your customers are spending billions of dollars on is going to be not as competitive with your new stuff very, very much more quickly than the depreciation cycle of that product. So, I'd like you to, if you wouldn't mind, speak a little bit about how you're seeing that situation evolve itself with customers. As you move to Blackwell, they're going to have very large installed bases, obviously software compatible, but large installed bases of product that's not nearly as performant as your new generation stuff. And it'd be interesting to hear what you see happening with customers along that path. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,14,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Yeah, really appreciate it. Three points that I'd like to make. If you're 5% into the build-out versus if you're 95% into the build-out, you're going to feel very differently. And because you're only 5% into the build-out anyhow, you build as fast as you can. And when Blackwell comes, it's going to be terrific. And then after Blackwell, as you mentioned, we have other Blackwells coming. And then there's a short -- we're in a one-year rhythm as we've explained to the world. And we want our customers to see our road map for as far as they like, but they're early in their build-out anyways and so they had to just keep on building, OK? And so, there's going to be a whole bunch of chips coming at them, and they just got to keep on building and just, if you will, performance-average your way into it. So, that's the smart thing to do. They need to make money today. They want to save money today. And time is really, really valuable to them. Let me give you an example of time being really valuable, why this idea of standing up a data center instantaneously is so valuable, and getting this thing called time-to-train is so valuable. The reason for that is because the next company who reaches the next major plateau gets to announce a groundbreaking AI. And the second one after that gets to announce something that's 0.3% better. And so, the question is, do you want to be repeatedly the company delivering groundbreaking AI or the company delivering 0.3% better? And that's the reason why this race, as in all technology races, the race is so important. And you're seeing this race across multiple companies because this is so vital to have technology leadership, for companies to trust the leadership that want to build on your platform and know that the platform that they're building on is going to get better and better. And so, leadership matters a great deal. Time-to-train matters a great deal. The difference between time-to-train that is three months earlier just to get it done, in order to get time-to-train on three months' project, getting started three months earlier is everything. And so, it's the reason why we're standing up Hopper systems like mad right now because the next plateau is just around the corner. And so, that's the second reason. The first comment that you made is really a great comment, which is how is it that we're moving so fast and advancing them quickly, because we have all the stacks here. We literally build the entire data center, and we can monitor everything, measure everything, optimize across everything. We know where all the bottlenecks are. We're not guessing about it. We're not putting up PowerPoint slides that look good. We're actually -- we also like our PowerPoint slides to look good, but we're delivering systems that perform at scale. And the reason why we know they perform at scale is because we built it all here. Now, one of the things that we do that's a bit of a miracle is that we build entire AI infrastructure here but then we disaggregate it and integrate it into our customers' data centers however they liked. But we know how it's going to perform, and we know where the bottlenecks are. We know where we need to optimize with them, and we know where we have to help them improve their infrastructure to achieve the most performance. This deep intimate knowledge at the entire data center scale is fundamentally what sets us apart today. We build every single chip from the ground up. We know exactly how processing is done across the entire system. And so, we understand exactly how it's going to perform and how to get the most out of it with every single generation. So, I appreciate it. Those are the three points. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Mark Lipacis with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,15,Mark Lipacis,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, in the past, you've made the observation that general-purpose computing ecosystems typically dominated each computing era. And I believe the argument was that they could adapt to different workloads, get higher utilization, drive cost of compute cycle down. And this is a motivation for why you were driving to a general-purpose GPU CUDA ecosystem for accelerated computing. And if I mischaracterized that observation, please do let me know. So, the question is, given that the workloads that are driving demand for your solutions are being driven by neural network training and inferencing, which on the surface seem like a limited number of workloads, then it might also seem to lend themselves to custom solutions. And so, then the question is, does the general-purpose computing framework become more at risk or is there enough variability or a rapid enough evolution on these workloads that support that historical general-purpose framework? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,16,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Yeah. NVIDIA's accelerated computing is versatile, but I wouldn't call it general purpose. Like, for example, we wouldn't be very good at running the spreadsheet. That was really designed for general-purpose computing. And so, the control loop of an operating system code probably isn't fantastic for general-purpose computing, not for accelerated computing. And so, I would say that we're versatile, and that's usually the way I describe it. There's a rich domain of applications that we're able to accelerate over the years, but they all have a lot of commonalities, maybe some deep differences, but commonalities. They're all things that I can run in parallel, they're all heavily threaded. 5% of the code represents 99% of the run time, for example. Those are all properties of accelerated computing. The versatility of our platform and the fact that we design entire systems is the reason why over the course of the last 10 years or so, the number of start-ups that you guys have asked me about in these conference calls is fairly large. And every single one of them, because of the brittleness of their architecture, the moment generative AI came along or the moment the fusion models came along, the moment the next models are coming along now, and now all of a sudden, look at this, large language models with memory because the large language model needs to have memory so they can carry on a conversation with you, understand the context. All of a sudden, the versatility of the Grace memory became super important. And so, each one of these advances in generative AI and the advancement of AI really begs for not having a widget that's designed for one model but to have something that is really good for this entire domain, properties of this entire domain, but obeys the first principles of software: that software is going to continue to evolve, that software is going to keep getting better and bigger. We believe in the scaling of these models. There's a lot of reasons why we're going to scale by easily 1 million times in the coming few years for good reasons, and we're looking forward to it, and we're ready for it. And so, the versatility of our platform is really quite key. And if you're too brittle and too specific, you might as well just build an FPGA or you build an ASIC or something like that, but that's hardly a computer.

I'm actually kind of curious, I mean, being supply constrained, how do you think about -- I mean, you came out with a product for China, H20. I'm assuming there'd be a ton of demand for it, but obviously, you're trying to serve your customers with the other Hopper products. Just kind of curious how you're thinking about that in the second half, if you could elaborate, any impact, what you're thinking for sales as well as gross margin.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,20,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Well, you know, we have customers that we honor and we do our best for every customer. It is the case that our business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past. And it's a lot more competitive in China now because of the limitations on our technology. And so, those matters are true. However, we continue to do our best to serve the customers in the markets there, and to the best of our ability, we'll do our best. But I think overall, the comments that we made about demand outstripping supply is for the entire market and particularly so for H200 and Blackwell toward the end of the year.

Jensen, actually more of a clarification on what you said. GB200 systems, it looks like there is a significant demand for systems. Historically, I think you've sold a lot of HGX boards and some GPUs and the systems business was relatively small. So, I'm just curious, why is it that now you are seeing such a strong demand for systems going forward? Is it just the TCO, or is it something else? Or is it just the architecture? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,22,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I appreciate that. In fact, the way we sell GB200 is the same. We disaggregate all of the components that make sense, and we integrate it into computer makers. We have 100 different computer system configurations that are coming this year for Blackwell. And that is off the charts. Hopper, frankly, had only half, but that's at its peak. It started out with way less than that even. And so, you're going to see liquid-cooled version, air-cooled version, x86 versions, Grace versions, so on and so forth. There's a whole bunch of systems that are being designed. And they're offered from all of our ecosystem of great partners. Nothing has really changed. Now, of course, the Blackwell platform has expanded our offering tremendously, the integration of CPUs, and the much more compressed density of computing. Liquid cooling is going to save data centers a lot of money in provisioning power and not to mention to be more energy efficient. And so, it's a much better solution. It's more expansive, meaning that we offer a lot more components of a data center. And everybody wins. The data center gets much higher performance, networking from networking switches, networking -- of course, NICs. We have Ethernet now so that we can bring AI to a large-scale NVIDIA AI to customers who only know how to operate Ethernet because of the ecosystem that they have. And so, Blackwell is much more expansive. We have a lot more to offer our customers this generation around. Operator Our next question will come from the line William Stein with Truist Securities. Please go ahead.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,23,William Stein,Truist Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thanks for taking my question. Jensen, at some point, NVIDIA decided that while there were reasonably good CPUs available for data center operations, your ARM-based Grace CPU provides some real advantage that made that technology worth to bring to customers, perhaps related to cost or power consumption or technical synergies between Grace and Hopper or Grace and Blackwell. Can you address whether there could be a similar dynamic that might emerge on the client side whereby, while there are very good solutions, you've highlighted that Intel and AMD are very good partners and deliver great products in x86, but there might be some, especially in emerging AI workloads, advantage that NVIDIA can deliver that others have more of a challenge?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,24,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Well, you mentioned some really good reasons. It is true that for many of the applications, our partnership with x86 partners are really terrific and we build excellent systems together. But Grace allows us to do something that isn't possible with the configuration, the system configuration today. The memory system between Grace and Hopper are coherent and connected. The interconnect between the two chips -- calling it two chips is almost weird because it's like a superchip. The two of them are connected with this interface that's like at terabytes per second. It's off the charts. And the memory that's used by Grace is LPDDR. It's the first data center-grade low-power memory. And so, we save a lot of power on every single node. And then finally, because of the architecture, because we can create our own architecture with the entire system now, we could create something that has a really large NVLink domain, which is vitally important to the next-generation large language models for inferencing. And so, you saw that GB200 has a 72-node NVLink domain. That's like 72 Blackwells connected together into one giant GPU. And so, we needed Grace Blackwells to be able to do that. And so, there are architectural reasons, there are software programming reasons and then there are system reasons that are essential for us to build them that way. And so, if we see opportunities like that, we'll explore it. And today, as you saw at the build yesterday, which I thought was really excellent, Satya announced the next-generation PCs, Copilot+ PC, which runs fantastically on NVIDIA's RTX GPUs that are shipping in laptops. But it also supports ARM beautifully. And so, it opens up opportunities for system innovation even for PCs. Operator Our last question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald.

I guess, Jensen, a bit of a longer-term question. I know Blackwell hasn't even launched yet, but obviously, investors are forward-looking. And amid rising potential competition from GPUs and custom ASICs, how are you thinking about NVIDIA's pace of innovation? And your million-fold scaling over the last decade, truly impressive, CUDA, precision, Grace, Cohere, and connectivity. When you look forward, what frictions need to be solved in the coming decade? And I guess maybe more importantly, what are you willing to share with us today?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/05/29/nvidia-nvda-q1-2025-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2025 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 29, 2024","March 31, 2024.",1,26,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Operating Officer,company,"-- Well, I can announce that after Blackwell, there's another chip. And we are on a one-year rhythm. And you can also count on us having new networking technology on a very fast rhythm. We're announcing Spectrum-X for Ethernet. But we're all in on Ethernet, and we have a really exciting road map coming for Ethernet. We have a rich ecosystem of partners. Dell announced that they're taking Spectrum-X to market. We have a rich ecosystem of customers and partners who are going to announce taking our entire AI factory architecture to market. And so, for companies that want the ultimate performance, we have InfiniBand computing fabric. InfiniBand is a computing fabric, Ethernet to network. And InfiniBand, over the years, started out as a computing fabric, became a better and better network. Ethernet is a network and with Spectrum-X, we're going to make it a much better computing fabric. And we're committed, fully committed, to all three links, NVLink computing fabric for single computing domain, to InfiniBand computing fabric, to Ethernet networking computing fabric. And so, we're going to take all three of them forward at a very fast clip. And so, you're going to see new switches coming, new NICs coming, new capability, new software stacks that run on all three of them. New CPUs, new GPUs, new networking NICs, new switches, a mound of chips that are coming. And all of it -- the beautiful thing is all of it runs CUDA. And all of it runs our entire software stack. So, if you invest today on our software stack, without doing anything at all, it's just going to get faster and faster and faster. And if you invest in our architecture today, without doing anything, it will go to more and more clouds and more and more data centers, and everything just runs. And so, I think the pace of innovation that we're bringing will drive up the capability, on the one hand, and drive down the TCO on the other hand. And so, we should be able to scale out with the NVIDIA architecture for this new era of computing and start this new industrial revolution where we manufacture not just software anymore, but we manufacture artificial intelligence tokens, and we're going to do that at scale.

Where do you think we are in the adoption curve in terms of your shipments into the generative AI market? Because when I just look at the trajectory of your data center, its growth, it will be close to nearly 30% of all the spending in data center next year.

We had seen historically over the last several quarters that China and some of the other impacted destinations to be about 20% to 25% of our data center revenue. We are expecting in our guidance for that to decrease substantially as we move into Q4. The export controls will have a negative effect on our China business, and we do not have good visibility into the magnitude of that impact even over the long term. We are, though, working to expand our data center product portfolio to possibly offer new regulation compliance solutions that do not require a license. These products, they may become available in the next coming months. However, we don't expect their contribution to be material or meaningful as a percentage of the revenue in Q4.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,3,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Generative AI is the largest TAM expansion of software and hardware that we've seen in several decades. At the core of it, what's really exciting is that what was largely a retrieval-based computing approach, almost everything that you do as we treated off of storage somewhere. As has been augmented now add it with a generative method, and it's changed almost everything. You could see that text to text, text to image, text to video, text to 3D, text to protein, text to chemicals. These are things that were processed and typed by humans in the past, and these are now generative approaches. The way that we access data has changed. It used to be based on explicit queries, it is now based on natural language queries, intention queries, semantic queries. And so, we're excited about the work that we're doing with SAP and Dropbox and many others that you're going to hear about. And one of the areas that is really impactful is the software industry, which is about $1 trillion or so has been building tools that are manually used over the last couple of decades. And now, there's a whole new segment of software called copilots and assistants, instead of manually use these tools will have copilots to help you use it. And so, instead of licensing software, we will continue to do that, of course, but we will also hire copilots and assistants to help us use the -- use the software. We'll connect all of these copilots and systems into teams of AI, which is going to be the modern version of software, modern version of enterprise business software. And so, the transformation of software and the way that software is done is driving the hardware underneath. And you can see that it's transforming in two ways. One is something that's largely independent of generative AI. There's two trends. One is related to accelerated computing. General-purpose computing is too wasteful of energy and cost. And now that we have a much, much better approaches called accelerated computing, you could save an order of magnitude of energy, you could save an order of magnitude of time where you can save an order of magnitude of cost by using acceleration. And so, accelerated computing is transitioning, if you will, general-purpose computing into this new approach. And that has been augmented by a new class of data centers. This is the traditional data centers that you were just talking about, where we represent about a third of that. But there's a new class of data centers. And this new class of data centers, unlike the data centers of the past where you have a lot of applications running used by a great many people that are different tenants that are using the same infrastructure, and the data center stores a lot of files. These new data essentials are very few applications if not one application used by basically one tenant. And it processes data. It trains models and it generates tokens, it generates AI. And we call these new data center AI factories. We're seeing AI factories being built out everywhere in just about every country. And so, if you look at the way where we are in the expansion, the transition into this new computing approach, the first wave you saw with large language model start-ups, generative AI start-ups, and consumer Internet companies. And we're in the process of ramping that. Meanwhile, that's being ramped. You see that we're starting to partner with enterprise software companies who would like to build chatbots and copilots and assistants to augment the tools that they have on their platforms. You're seeing GPU-specialized CSPs cropping up all over the world, and they're dedicated to doing really one thing, which is processing AI. You're seeing sovereign AI infrastructures, people, countries that now recognize that they have to utilize their own data, keep their own data, keep their own culture, process that data, and develop their own AI. You see that in India. Several -- about a year ago in Sweden, you're seeing in Japan. Last week, a big announcement in France. But the number of sovereign AI clouds that are being built is really quite significant. And my guess is that almost every major region will have, and surely, every major country will have their own AI cloud. And so, I think you're seeing just new developments as the generative AI wave propagates through every industry, every company, every region. And so, we're at the beginning of this inflection, this computing transition. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,4,Aaron Rakers,Well Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to ask about kind of the networking side of the business. Given the growth rates that you've now cited. I think it's 155% year over year and strong growth sequentially. It looks like that business is like almost approaching a $2.5 billion to $3 billion quarterly level. I'm curious of how you see Ethernet involved -- evolving and maybe how you would characterize your differentiation of Spectrum X relative to the traditional Ethernet stack as we start to think about that becoming part of the networking narrative above and maybe beyond just InfiniBand as we look into next year? Thank you.,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,5,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question. Our networking business is already at a $10 billion-plus run rate. And it's going to get much larger. And as you mentioned, we added a new networking platform to our networking business recently. The vast majority of the dedicated large-scale AI factories standardized on InfiniBand. And the reason for that is really because of its data rate and not only just the latency but the way that it moves traffic around the network is really important. The way that you process AI and a multi-tenant hyperscale Ethernet environment, the traffic pattern is just radically different. And with InfiniBand and with software-defined networks, we could do congestion control, adaptive routing, performance isolation, and noise isolation, not to mention, of course, the data rate and the low latency that -- and the very low overhead of InfiniBand that's a natural part of InfiniBand. And so, InfiniBand is not so much just a network. It's also a computing fabric. We put a lot of software-defined capabilities into the fabric, including computation. We do floating point calculations and computation right on the switch and right in the fabric itself. And so, that's the reason why that difference in Ethernet versus InfiniBand where InfiniBand versus Ethernet for AI factories is so dramatic. And the difference is profound and the reason for that is because you've just invested in a $2 billion infrastructure for AI factories, a 20%, 25%, 30% difference in overall effectiveness, especially as you scale up is measured in hundreds of millions of dollars of value. And if you were renting that infrastructure over the course of four or five years, it really adds up. And so, InfiniBand's value proposition is undeniable for AI factories. However, as we move AI into enterprise, this is enterprise computing where we'd like to enable every company to be able to build their own custom AI. We're building customer AIs in our company based on our proprietary data, our proprietary type of skills. For example, recently, we spoke about one of the models that we're creating. It's called Chip Nemo. We're building many others. There'll be tens, hundreds of custom AI models that we create inside our company. And our company is -- for all of our employees, doesn't have to be as high performance as the AI factories, we use to train the models. And so, we would like the AI to be able to run an Ethernet environment. And so, what we've done is we invented this new platform that extends Ethernet. It doesn't replace the Ethernet, it's 100% compliant with Ethernet, and it's optimized for east-west traffic, which is where the computing fabric is. It adds to Ethernet with an end-to-end solution with Bluefield as well as our Spectrum switch that allows us to perform some of the capabilities that we have in InfiniBand, not all but some, and we achieved excellent results. And the way we go to market is we go to market with our large enterprise partners who already offer our computing solution. And so, HPL and Lenovo have the NVIDIA AI stack, the NVIDIA enterprise software stack. And now they integrate with BlueField as well as bundle take to market their Spectrum switch and they'll be able to offer enterprise customers all over the world with their vast sales force and vast network of resellers the -- in a fully integrated, if you will, fully optimized at least end-to-end AI solution. And so, that's basically bringing AI to Ethernet for the world's enterprise. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joe Moore of Morgan Stanley.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,6,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thank you. I wondered if you could talk a little bit more about Grace Hopper and how you see the ability to leverage kind of the microprocessor, how you see that as a TAM expander. And what applications do you see using Grace Hopper versus more traditional H100 applications?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,7,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for your question. Grace Hopper is in production in high-volume production now. We're expecting next year just with all of the design wins that we have in high-performance computing and AI, AI infrastructures. We are on a very, very fast ramp with our first data center CPU to a multibillion-dollar product line. This is going to be a very large product line for us. The capability of Grace Hopper is really quite spectacular. It has the ability to create compute nodes that simultaneously have very fast memory as well as very large memory. In the areas of vector databases or semantic search, what is called REG, retrieval augmented generation, so that you could have a generative AI model, be able to refer to proprietary data or factful data before it generates a response. That data is quite large. And you could also have applications or generative models where the context length is very high. You basically store an entire book into its system memory before you ask a question. And so, the context link can be quite large. This way, the degenerative models have the ability to still be able to naturally interact with you on one hand, on the other hand, be able to refer to factual data, proprietary data or domain-specific data, newer data, and be continually relevant and reduce hallucination. And so, that particular use case, for example, is really quite fantastic for Grace Hopper. It also serves the customers that really care to have a different CPU the X86, maybe it's European supercomputing centers or European companies who would like to build up their own ARM ecosystem and I'd like to build up a stack or CSPs that have decided that they would like to pivot ARM because their own custom CPUs are based on ARM. There are a variety of different reasons that drives the success of Grace Hopper, but we're off to just an extraordinary start. This is a home run product.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,8,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thanks. I wanted to ask a little bit about the visibility you have on revenue. I know there's a few moving parts, I guess, on one hand, the purchase commitments went up a lot again. But on the other hand, China bands would arguably pull in when you can fill the demand beyond China. So, I know we're not even into 2024 yet. And it doesn't sound like, Jen-Hsun, you think that next year would be a peak in your data center revenue, but I just wanted to sort of explicitly ask you that. Do you think that data center can grow even into 2025? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,9,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Absolutely believe that data center can grow through 2025. And there are, of course, several reasons for that. We are expanding our supply quite significantly. We have already won the broadest and largest and most capable supply chain in the world. Remember, people think that the GPU is a chip, but the HGX, H100, the Hopper HGX has 35,000 parts. It weighs 70 pounds. Eight of the chips are Hopper. The other 35,000 are not. It is -- it has -- even its passive components are incredible, high-voltage parts, high-frequency parts, high-current parts. It is a supercomputer and therefore, the only way to test the supercomputers with another supercomputer. Even the manufacturing of it is complicated, the testing of it is complicated, the shipping event is complicated, and installation is complicated. And so, every aspect of our HGX supply chain is complicated. And the remarkable team that we have here has really scaled out the supply chain incredibly not to mention all of our HDX are connected with MBA networking and the networking, the transceivers, the mics, the cables, the switches, the amount of complexity there is just incredible. And so, I'm just -- first of all, I'm just super proud of the team for scaling up this incredible supply chain. We are absolutely world-class. But meanwhile, we're adding new customers and new products. So, we have new supply. We have new customers. As I was mentioning earlier, different regions are standing up GPU specialist clouds. Sovereign AI clouds coming up from all over the world as people realize that they can't afford to export their country's knowledge, their country's culture for somebody else to then resell AI back to them. They have to -- they should. They have the skills and fairly with us, in combination, we can help them do that, build up their national AI. And so, the first thing that they have to do is create their AI cloud national AI cloud. You're also seeing us now growing into enterprise. The enterprise market has two paths, one path, or if I could say, three paths. The first half, of course, off-the-shelf AI. And there are, of course, Chat-GPT fabulous off-the-shelf AI, there'll be others. There's also a proprietary AI because the software companies like ServiceNow and SAP and there are many, many others, I can't afford to have their company's intelligence be outsourced to somebody else. And they are about building tools. And on top of their tools, they should build custom and proprietary, and domain-specific copilots and assistants that they can rent to their customer base. This is -- they're sitting on a gold mine. Almost every major tools company in the world is sitting on gold mine, and they recognize that. They have to go build their own custom AIs. We have a new service called an AI Foundry, where we leverage NVS capabilities to be able to serve them in that. And then the next one is on enterprises building their own custom AI their own custom chatbots, their own custom. And this capability is spreading all over the world. And the way that we're going to serve that marketplace is with the entire stacks of systems, which includes our compute, our networking and our switches running our software stack called NVIDIA AI enterprise taking it through our market partners, HP, Dell, and Lenovo, so on and so forth. And so, we're just -- we're seeing the waves of generative AI starting from the start-ups and CSPs moving to consumer Internet companies moving to enterprise software platforms, moving to enterprise companies. And then -- and ultimately, one of the areas that you guys have seen us spend a lot of energy on has to do with industrial generative AI. This is where NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse comes together. And that is a really, really exciting work. And so, I think the -- we're at the beginning of a and basically across-the-board industrial transition to generative AI to accelerated computing. This is going to affect every company, every industry, every country. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

I wanted to clarify something with Colette real quick, and then I had a question for Jen-Hsun as well. Colette mentioned that you'll be introducing regulation-compliant products over the next couple of months, yet the contribution to Q4 revenue should be relatively limited. Is that a timing issue? And could it be a source of reacceleration in growth for decenter in April and beyond? Or are the price points such that the contribution to revenue going forward should be relatively limited? And then the question for Jen-Hsun. The AI foundry service announcement from last week, I just wanted to ask about that and hopefully have you expand on it. How is the monetization model going to work? Is it primarily services and software revenue? How should we think about the long-term opportunity set? And is this going to be exclusive to Microsoft or do you have plans to expand to other partners as well?

On the question regarding potentially new products that we could provide to our China customers. It's a significant process to both design and develop these new products. As we discussed, we're going to make sure that we are in full discussions with the U.S. government of our intent in these products as well. Given our state about where we are in the quarter, we're already several weeks into the quarter, that's just going to take some time for us to go through and discussing with our customers the needs and desires of these two products that we have. And going forward, whether that's medium term or long term, it's just hard to say both the ideas of what we can produce with the U.S. government and with the interest of our China customers. So, we stay still focused on finding that right balance for our China customers, but it's hard to say at this time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,12,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks for the question. There is a glaring opportunity in the world for AI foundry. And it makes so much sense. First, every company has its core intelligence. It makes up our company. Our data, our domain expertise. In the case of many companies, we create tools. And most of the software companies in the world are tool platforms. And those tools are used by people today. And in the future, it's going to be used by people augmented with a whole bunch of AIs that we hire. And these platforms just got to go across the world, and you'll see, and we've already announced a few SAP, ServiceNow, Dropbox, Getty, many others are coming. And the reason for that is because they have their own proprietary AI, and they want their own proprietary AI. They can't afford to outsource their intelligence and hand out their data and hand out their flywheel for other companies to build the AI for them. And so, they come to us. We have several things that are really essential in the foundry, just as TSMC is a foundry, you have to have AI technology. And as you know, we have just an incredible depth of capability, AI technology capability. And then second, you have to have the best practice known practice, the skills of processing data through the invention of AI models to create AIs that are guardrails fine-tuned, so on and so forth that are safe, so on and so forth. And the third thing is unique factories, and that's what DGX Cloud is. Our AI models are called AI foundations. Our process, if you will, our CAD systems for creating AIs are called NEMO, and they run on NVIDIA factories we call DGX Cloud. Our monetization model is that with each one of our partners, they rent a sandbox on DGX Cloud where we work together. They bring their data. They bring their domain expertise. We've got our researchers and engineers. We help them build their custom AI. We help them make that custom AI incredible. Then that customer AI becomes theirs, and they deploy it on a run time that is enterprise-grade, enterprise-optimized, or outperformance-optimized runs across everything NVIDIA. We have a giant installed base in the cloud on-prem anywhere. And it's secure, securely patched, constantly patched and optimized and supported. And we call that NVIDIA AI enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is $4,500 per GP per year. That's our business model. Our business model is basically a license. Our customers then, with that basic license, can build their monetization model on top of. In a lot of ways, we're wholesale. They become retail. They could have a per-subscription license base. They could per instance, or they could do per usage. There's a lot of different ways that they could take to create their own business model, but ours is basically like a software license like an operating system. And so, our business model is help you create your custom models, you run those custom models on NVIDIA AI Enterprise. And it's off to a great start. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is going to be a very large business for us. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Stacy Rasgon of Bernstein Research.

Colette, I wanted to know if it weren't for the China restrictions, would the Q4 guide have been higher or are you supply constrained in just reshipping stuff that would have gone to China elsewhere?

And does the China redirection such as is it lowering those lead times because you've got parts that are sort of immediately available to ship?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/

Stacy, let me see if I can help you understand. Yes, they are still situations where we are working on both improving our supply each and every quarter. We've done a really solid job of ramping every quarter, which is to find our revenue. But with the absence of China, for our outlook for Q4, sure, there could have been some things that we are not supply constrained that we could have sold to China, but we no longer can. So, could our guidance have been a little higher in our Q4? Yes. We are still working on improving our supply and plan on continuing and growing all throughout next year as well toward that.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,15,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Congrats everybody on the results. Jen-Hsun, I had a two-part question for you, and it comes off of sort of one premise. And the premise is I still get a lot of questions from investors thinking about AI training as being NVIDIA's dominant domain and that somehow as inference, even large model inference takes more and more of the TAM that the market will become more competitive, you'll be less differentiated, etc., etc. So, I guess the two parts of the question are, number one, maybe you could spend a little bit of time talking about the evolution of the inference workload as we move to LLM and how your company is positioned for that rather than smaller model inference. And second, up until a month or two ago, I never really got any questions at all about the data processing piece of the AI workload. So, the pieces of manipulating the data before training, between training and inference, after inference. And I think that's a large part of the workload now. Maybe you could talk about how CUDA is enabling acceleration of those pieces of the workload. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,16,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Sure. Inference, inference is complicated. It's actually incredibly complicated. If you – we, this quarter, announced one of the most exciting new engines optimizing compilers called TensorRT LM. The reception has been incredible. You go to GitHub. It's been downloaded a ton, a whole lot of stars integrated into stacks and frameworks all over the world, almost instantaneously. And there are several reasons for that, obviously. We could create TensorRT LLM because CUDA's programmable. If CUDA and our GPUs were not so programmable, it would really be hard for us to improve software stacks at the pace that we do. TensorRT LLM on the same GPU without anybody touching anything, improves the performance by a factor of two. And then on top of that, of course, the pace of our innovation is so high. H200 increases it by another factor of two. And so, our inference performance another way of saying inference cost just reduced by a factor of four within about a year's time. And so, that's really, really hard to keep up with. Now, the reason why everybody likes our inference engine is because our installed base. And we've been dedicated to our installed base for 20 years, 20-plus years. We have an installed base that is not only largest in every single cloud, it's in every available from every enterprise system maker. It's used by companies of just about every industry. And any time you see an NVIDIA GPU, it runs our stack. It's architecturally compatible. It's something we've been dedicated to for a very long time. We're very disciplined about it. We make it, if you will, architecture compatibility is job one. And that has conveyed to the world the certainty of our platform stability. NVIDIA's platform stability certainty is the reason why everybody builds on us first and the reason why everybody optimizes on us first. All the engineering and all the work that you do, all the invention of technologies that you build on top of NVIDIA accrues to the -- and benefits everybody that uses our GPUs, and we have such a large installed base, millions and millions of GPUs in cloud, 100 million GPU from people's PCs, just about every workstation in the world, and they're all architecturally compatible. And so, if you're an inference platform and you are deploying an inference application, you are basically an application provider and as a software application provider, and you're looking for a large installed base. Data processing, before you could train a model, you have to augment the data. You have to debug the data, maybe you have to augment the data with synthetic data. So, you process that they clean the data, align the data, normalize the data, all of that data is measured not in bites and megabytes. It's measured in terabytes and petabytes. And the amount of data processing that you do before data engineering before that you do training is quite significant. It could represent 30%, 40%, 50% of the amount of work that you ultimately do. In what you -- in ultimately creating a data-driven machine learning service. And so, data processing is just a massive part. We accelerate Spark. We accelerate Python. One of the coolest things that we just did, it's called cuDF Pandas. Without one line of code, Pandas, which is the single most successful data science framework in the world, Pandas now is accelerated by NVIDIA CUDA and just out of the box without the line of code. And so, the acceleration is really quite terrific. And people are just incredibly excited about. And Pandas was designed for one purpose and one purpose only really data processing for data science. And so, NVIDIA CUDA gives you all of that. Operator Your final question comes from the line of Harlan Sur of JPMorgan.

Thanks for taking my question. If you look at the history of the tech industry, right, those companies that have been successful have always been focused on ecosystem silicon, hardware, software, strong partnerships, and just as importantly, right, an aggressive cadence of new products, more segmentation over time. The team recently announced a more aggressive new product cadence and data center from two years and now every year with higher levels of segmentation, training, optimization, inferencing, CPU, GDP, GPU networking. How do we think about your R&D opex growth to support a more aggressive and expanding for road map? But more importantly, what is the team doing to manage and drive execution through all of this complexity?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/11/22/nvidia-nvda-q3-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,18,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Gosh, you know, boy, that's just really excellent. You just wrote NVIDIA's business plan. And you described our strategy. First of all, there is a fundamental reason why we accelerate our execution. And the reason for that is because it fundamentally drives down cost. When the combination of TensorRT LLM and 200 reduced the cost for our customers for large model inference by a factor of four. And so, that includes, of course, our speeds and feeds, but mostly it's because of our software, mostly the software benefits because of the architecture. And so, we want to accelerate our road map for that reason. The second reason is to expand the reach of generative AI. The world's number of data center configurations, this is kind of the amazing thing. NVIDIA is in every cloud, but not one cloud is the same. NVIDIA is working with every single cloud service provider and not one of their networking control plane security posture is the same. Everybody's platform is different. And yet we're integrated into all of their stacks, all of their data centers, and we work incredibly well with all of them. And not to mention, we didn't take the whole thing, and we create AI factories that are stand-alone. We take our platform. We can put them into supercomputers. We can put them into enterprise. Bringing AI to enterprise is something generative AI to enterprise something nobody has ever done before. And we're right now in the process of going to market with all of that. And so, the complexity includes, of course, all the technologies and segments and the pace, it includes the fact that we are architecturally compatible across every single one of those. And it's all of the domain-specific libraries that we create. The reason why you -- every computer company, without thinking, can integrate NVIDIA into their road map and take it to market, and the reason for that is because there's market demand for it. There's market demand and healthcare. There's market demand in manufacturing, there's market demand, and of course, in AI, in financial services and supercomputing, and quantum computing. The list of markets and segments that we have domain-specific libraries is incredibly broad. And then finally, now we have an end-to-end solution for data centers. InfiniBand network, InfiniBand networking, Ethernet networking, x86 ARM, just about every permutation combination of solutions, technology solutions, and software stacks provided. And that translates to having the largest number of ecosystem software developers, the largest ecosystem of system makers, the largest and broadest distribution partnership network, and ultimately, the greatest reach. And that takes – surely, that takes a lot of energy. But the thing that really holds together, and this is -- this is a great decision that we made decades ago, which is everything is architecturally compatible. When you -- when we develop a domain-specific language that runs on one GPU, it runs on every GPU. When we optimize TensorRT for the cloud, we optimize it for enterprise. When we do something that brings in a new feature, a new library, a new feature, or a new developer, they instantly get the benefit of all of our reach. And so, that discipline, that architecture-compatible discipline that has lasted more than a couple of decades now is one of the reasons why NVIDIA is still really, really efficient. I mean, we're 28,000 people large and serving just about every single company, every single industry, every single market around the world. Operator Thank you.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 22, 2023","September 30, 2023.",1,19,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Our strong growth reflects the broad industry platform transition from general-purpose to accelerated computing and Generative AI. Large language model start-ups, consumer Internet companies, and global cut service providers are the first movers. The next waves are starting to build. Nations and regional CSPs are building AI clouds to serve local demand. Enterprise software companies like Adobe and Dropbox, SAP, and ServiceNow are adding AI copilots and assistants to their platforms. And enterprises in the world's largest industries are creating custom AIs to automate and boost productivity. The generative AI era is in full steam and has created the need for a new type of data center and AI factory, optimized for refining data and training and inference and generating AI. AI factory workloads are different and incremental to legacy data center workloads supporting IT tasks. AI factories run copilots and AI assistants, which are significant software TAM expansion and are driving significant new investment, expanding the $1 trillion traditional data center infrastructure installed base, empowering the AI industrial revolution. NVIDIA H100 HGX with InfiniBand and the NVIDIA AI software stack defined an AI factory today. As we expand our supply chain to meet the world's demand, we are also building new growth drivers for the next wave of AI. We highlighted three elements to our new growth strategy that are hitting their stride, CPU, networking, and software and services. Grace is NVIDIA first, data center CPU. Grace and Grace Hopper are in full production and ramping into a new multibillion-dollar product line next year, irrespective of the CPU choice. We can help customers build an AI factory. NVIDIA networking now exceeds a $10 billion annualized revenue run rate. InfiniBand grew fivefold year over year and is positioned for excellent growth ahead as the networking of AI factories. Enterprises are also racing to adopt AI and Ethernet is the standard networking. This week, we announced an Ethernet for AI platform for enterprises. NVIDIA Spectrum X is an end-to-end solution of Bluefield Super Spectrum 4 Ethernet switch and software that boosts Ethernet performance by up to 1.6x for AI workloads. Dell, HP, and Lenovo have joined us to bring a full generative AI solution of NVIDIA AI computing, networking, and software to the world's enterprises. NVIDIA Software and Services is on track to exit the year at an annualized run rate of $1 billion. Enterprise software platforms like ServiceNow and SAP need to build and operate proprietary AI. Enterprises need to build and deploy custom AI copilots. We have the AI technology, expertise, and scale to help customers build custom models. With their proprietary data on NVIDIA DGX cloud and deploy the AI applications on enterprise-grade NVIDIA AI enterprise. NVIDIA is essentially an AI foundry.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,1,Matt Ramsay,TD Cowen -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Obviously, remarkable results. Jensen, I wanted to ask a question of you regarding the really quickly emerging application of -- of large model inference. So, I think it's pretty well understood by the majority of investors that you guys have a very much a lockdown share of the training market. A lot of the smaller market -- smaller -- smaller model inference workloads have been done on ASICs or CPUs in the past. And with many of these GPT and other really large models, there's this new workload that's accelerating super-duper quickly on -- on large model inference. And I think your -- your Grace Hopper Superchip products and others are pretty well aligned for that. But could you maybe talk to us about how you're seeing the inference market segment between small model inference and large model inference and how your product portfolio is positioned for that? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,2,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, thanks a lot. So, let's take a quick step back. These large language models are -- are fairly -- are pretty phenomenal. It -- it does several things, of course. It has the ability to understand unstructured language. But at its core, what it has learned is the structure of human language and it has encoded or within it -- compressed within it a large amount of human knowledge that it has learned by the corpuses that it studied. What happens is you create these large language models and you create as large as you can, and then you derive from it smaller versions of the model, essentially teach-your-student models. It's a process called distillation. And -- and so, when you see these smaller -- smaller models, it's very likely the case that they were derived from or distilled from or learned from larger models, and just as you have professors and teachers and students and so on, so forth. And you're going to see this going forward. And so, you start from a very large model and it has to build -- it has a large amount of generality and generalization and -- and what's called zero-shot capability. And so, for a lot of applications and questions or skills that you haven't trained it specifically on, these large language models, miraculously, has the capability to perform them. That's what makes it so magical. On the other hand -- on the other hand, you -- you -- you would like to have these capabilities and all kinds of computing devices. And so, what you do is you distill them down. These smaller models might have excellent capabilities in a particular skill, but they don't generalize as well. They don't have what is called as-good zero-shot capabilities. And so, they all have their own -- own unique capabilities, but -- but you start from very large models. Operator OK, next, we'll go to Vivek Arya with BofA Securities.

Just had a quick clarification on a question. Colette, if you could please clarify how much incremental supply do you expect to come online in the next year? You think it's up 20, 30, 40, 50%? So, just any sense of how much supply because you said it's growing every quarter. And then, Jensen, the question for you is, when we look at the overall hyperscaler spending, that pie is not really growing that much. So, what is giving you the confidence that they can continue to carve out more of that pie for generative AI? Just give us your sense of how sustainable is this demand as we look over the next one to two years. So, if I take your implied Q3 outlook of data center, 12 billion,13 billion, what does that say about how many servers are already AI accelerated? Where is that going? So, just give us some confidence that the growth that you are seeing is sustainable into the next one to two years.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/

Yes, we -- we do expect to continue increasing, ramping our supply over the next quarter, as well as into next fiscal year. In terms of percent, that's not something that we -- we have here. It is a work across so many different suppliers, so many different parts of building, and -- and HGX many of our other new products that are coming to market. But we are very pleased with both the support that we have with our suppliers and the long time that we have spent with them improving their supply.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,5,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The world has something along the lines of about $1 trillion worth of data centers installed in the cloud and enterprise and otherwise. And that trillion dollars of data centers is in the process of transitioning into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're seeing two simultaneous platform shifts at the same time. One is accelerated computing, and the reason for that is because it's the most cost-effective, most energy-effective, and the most performant way of doing computing now. And so -- so, what you're seeing -- and then, all of a sudden enabled by generative AI -- enabled by accelerated computing, generative AI came along. And this incredible application now gives everyone two reasons to transition, to do a platform shift from general purpose computing, the classical way of doing computing, to this new way of doing computing, accelerated computing. There's about $1 trillion worth of data centers, call it, a quarter of trillion dollars of -- of capital spend each year. You're seeing the -- the data centers around the world are taking that capital spend and focusing it on the two most important trends of -- of computing today, accelerated computing and generative AI. And so, I think this is not a -- this is not a -- a near-term thing. This is a -- a long-term industry transition, and we're seeing these two platform shifts happening at the same time.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,6,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I was wondering, Colette, if you could tell me like how much of data center in the quarter, maybe even the guidance, like, systems versus GPU, like DGX versus just the H100. What I'm really trying to get at is how much is like pricing or content, or however you want to define that, versus units actually driving the growth going forward. Can you give us any color around that?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,7,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Sure, Stacy. Let me help. Within the quarter, our HGX systems were a very significant part of our data center as well as our data center growth that we had seen. Those systems include our HGX of our Hopper architecture but also our Ampere architecture. Yes, we are still selling -- both of these architectures are in the market. Now, when you think about that, what does that mean from both the systems as a unit, of course, is growing quite substantially, and that is driving in terms of the revenue increases. So, both of these things are the drivers of the revenue inside data center. Our DGXs are always a portion of additional systems that we will sell. Those are a great opportunity for our enterprise customers and many other different types of customers that we're seeing even in our consumer internet companies. Now, the importance there is also coming together with software that we sell with our DGXs, but that's a portion of our sales that we're doing. The rest of the GPUs, we have new GPUs coming to market that we talk about, the L40S, and they will add continued growth going forward. But again, the largest driver of our revenue within this last quarter was definitely the HGX system.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- And, Stacy, if I could just add something. The -- you -- you say it's H100, and I know you know what your -- your -- your mental image in your mind, but the H100 is 35,000 parts, 70 pounds, nearly a trillion transistors in combination; takes a robot to build -- well, many robots to build because it's 70 pounds to lift. And it takes a supercomputer to test a supercomputer. And so, these -- these things are technology marvels, and -- and the manufacturing of them is really intensive. And so -- so I think we -- you know, we call it H100 as if it's a chip that comes off of a fab, but H100s go -- go out really as HGX as they are the world's hyperscalers, and -- and they're really really quite large system components, if you will.

Jensen, it seems like the -- a key part of the success -- your success in the market is delivering the software ecosystem along with the chip and the hardware platform. And I had a two-part question on this. I was wondering if you could just help us understand the evolution of your software ecosystem, the critical elements. And is there a way to quantify your lead on this dimension, like how many person years you've invested in building it? And then, part two, I was wondering if you would care to share with us your view on what percentage of the value of the Nvidia platform is hardware differentiation versus software differentiation. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,10,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Mark, thanks for your question. The -- let me see if I could use some metrics. So, we have a runtime score in the AI enterprise. This is -- this is one part of our software stack. And this is -- this is, if you will, the runtime that just about every company uses for the end-to-end of machine learning, from data processing, the training of any model that you -- that you like to do on any framework you like to do, the inference, and the deployment, the scaling it out into data center, could be a scale-out for a hyperscale data center, could be a scale-out for enterprise data center, for example, on VMware. You can do this on any of our GPUs. We have hundreds of millions of GPUs in the field and millions of GPUs in the cloud in just about every single cloud. And it runs in a single GPU configuration as well as multi-GPU per compute or multi-node. It also has multiple -- multiple sessions or multiple -- multiple computing instances per GPU. So, from multiple instances per GPU to multiple GPUs, multiple nodes, to entire data center scale. So, this runtime called NVIDIA AI Enterprise has something like 4,500 software packages, software libraries and has something like 10,000 dependencies among each other. And that runtime is -- is, as I mentioned, continuously updated and optimized for -- for our install base for our stack. And that's just one example of what it would take to get accelerated computing to work that the number of -- of code combinations and type of application combinations is really quite insane. And that's taken us two decades to get here. But what I would -- what I would -- what I would characterize as probably our -- are the elements of our -- of our -- of our company, if you will, are several. I would say number one is architecture. The flexibility, the versatility, and the performance of our architecture makes it possible for us to do all the things that I just said, you know, from data processing to training, to inference, for preprocessing of the data before you do the inference, to the post-processing of the data, tokenizing of -- of -- of -- of languages so that you could then train -- train with it. The amount of the workflow is much more intense than just training or inference. But anyways, that's where we'll focus, and is fine. But -- but when people actually use these computing systems, it's quite -- requires a lot of applications. And so, the combination of our architecture makes it possible for us to deliver the lowest cost of ownership. And the reason for that is because -- because we accelerate so many different things. The second characteristic of our -- of our company is the install base. You know, you have to ask yourself why is it that all the software developers come to our platform. And the reason for that is because software developers seek a large install base so that they can reach the largest number of end users so that they could build a business or get a return on the investments that they make. And -- and then, the third characteristic is reach. We're in the cloud today, both for public cloud -- public-facing cloud because we have so many customers that use -- so many developers and customers, they use our -- our platform. CSPs are delighted to put it up in the cloud. They use it for internal consumption, you know, to develop and train and operate recommender systems or search or data processing engines and whatnot, all the way to training and inference. And so, we're in the cloud, we're in enterprise. Yesterday, we had a very big announcement. It's really worthwhile to -- to take a look at that. VMware is the operating system of the world's enterprise. And we've been working together for several years now and we're going to bring together -- together, we're going to bring generative AI to the world's enterprises all the way out to the edge. And so, reach is another reason. And because of reach, all of the world's system makers are anxious to put Nvidia's platform in their systems. And so, we have a very broad distribution from all of the world's OEMs and ODMs and so on and so forth because of our reach. And then, lastly, because of our scale and velocity, we were -- we were able to sustain this -- this really complex stack of software and hardware and networking and compute and across all of these different usage models and different computing environments. And we're able to -- to do all this while accelerating the velocity of our engineering. You know, it seems like we're introducing a new architecture every two years now. We're introducing a new architecture, a new new product just about every six months. And so, these -- these properties make it possible for the ecosystem to build their company and their business on top of us. And so, those in combination makes it special.

And great job on the results and outlook. Colette, I have a question on the cool-off list, L40S that you guys talked about. Any idea how much of the supply tightness can L40S help with?

Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,12,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Atif, let me -- let me take that for -- for you. The L40 -- L40S is really designed for a different type of application. H100 is designed for large-scale language models and processing, just very large models and a great deal of data. And so, that's -- that's not L40S' focus. L40S' focus is to be able to fine-tune models -- fine-tune pre-trained models and it'll do that incredibly well. It has a transformer engine. It's got a lot of performance. You can get multiple GPUs in a -- in a server. It's designed for -- for hyperscale scale-out, meaning it's easy to -- to -- to install L40S servers into the world's hyperscale data centers. It comes in a standard rack, standard server. And everything about it is standard, and so it's easy to install. L40S also is, with the software stack around it and along with BlueField-3, and all the work that we did with VMware and the work that we did with Snow -- Snowflake's and -- and ServiceNow and so many other enterprise partners, L40S is designed for the world's enterprise IT systems. And that's the reason why HPE, Dell, and Lenovo, and some 20 other system makers building about 100 different configurations of enterprise servers are going to work with us to take generative AI to the world's enterprise. And so, L40S is really designed for -- for a different -- different type of scale-out, if you will. It's, of course, large language models. It's, of course, generative AI, but it's a different use case. And the L40S is going to -- is off to a great start, and, you know, the world's enterprise and hyperscalers are really clamoring to get -- get L40S deployed.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,13,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Great. Thank you. I guess the thing about these numbers that's so remarkable to me is the amount of demand that remains unfulfilled. Talking to some of your customers, you know, as good as these numbers are, you sort of more than tripled your revenue in a couple of quarters. There's -- there's a demand, in some cases, for -- for multiples of what people are getting. So, can you talk about that, how much-unfulfilled demand do you think there is? And you talked about visibility extending into next year. Do you have a line of sight into when you'll get to see supply demand equilibrium here?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,14,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah, we have excellent visibility through the year and into next year. And we're already planning the next-generation infrastructure with the leading CSPs and data center builders. The demand -- the easiest way to think about the demand is the world is transitioning from general-purpose computing to accelerated computing. That's the easiest way to think about the demand. The best way for companies to increase their throughput, improve their energy efficiency, improve their cost efficiency, is to divert their capital budget to accelerated computing and generative AI. Because by doing that, you're going to offload so much workload off of the CPUs that the available CPUs is -- in your data center will get boosted. And -- and so, what you're seeing companies do now is recognizing this -- this, the tipping point here, recognizing the beginning of this transition, and diverting their capital investment to accelerated computing and generative AI. And so -- so, that's -- that's probably the easiest way to think about the opportunity ahead of us. This isn't a -- a singular application that -- that is driving the demand, but this is a new computing platform, if you will, a new computing transition that's happening, and data centers all over the world are responding to this and shifting, you know, in a broad-based way.

I had one quick clarification question for Colette and then another one for Jensen. Colette, I think, last quarter, you had said CSPs were about 40% of your data center revenue; consumer internet, 30%; enterprise, 30%. Based on your remarks, it sounded like CSPs and consumer internet may have been a larger percentage of your business. If you can kind of clarify that or confirm that, that would be super helpful. And then, Jensen, a question for you. You know, given your position as the key enabler of AI, the breadth of engagements and the visibility you have into customer projects, I'm curious how confident you are that there will be enough applications or use cases for your customers to generate a reasonable return on their investments. I guess I asked the question because there is a concern out there that, you know, there could be a bit of a pause in your -- in your demand profile in the outyears. Curious, you know, if there's enough breadth and depth there to -- to support a sustained increase in your data center business going forward.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Toshi, I'm reluctant to -- to guess about the future, and so I'll answer the question from the first principle of computer science perspective. It is -- it is recognized, for some time now, that general-purpose computing is just not in-brute forcing general-purpose computing. Using general-purpose computing at scale is no longer the best way to go forward. It's too costly, it's too expensive, and the performance of the applications are too slow, right? And finally, the world has a new way of doing it. It's called accelerated computing. And what kicked it into turbocharge is generative AI. But accelerated computing could be used for all kinds of different applications that's already in the data center. And by using it, you offload the CPUs, you save a ton of money, an order of magnitude in cost and order of magnitude in energy, and the throughput is higher. And -- and that's what -- that's what the industry is really responding to. Going forward, the best way to invest in a data center is to divert the capital investment from general-purpose computing and focus it on generative AI and accelerated computing. Generative AI provides a new way of generating productivity, a new way of generating new services to offer to your customers, and accelerated computing helps you save money and save power. And -- and the number of applications is -- is, well, you know, tons, lots of developers, lots of applications, lots of libraries. It's ready to be deployed. And so, I think -- I think the data centers around the world recognize that this is the -- the best way to deploy resources, deploy capital going forward for data centers. This is true for the world's clouds, and -- and -- and you're seeing a whole crop of -- of new GPUs -- specialty GPU-specialized cloud service providers. One of the famous ones is CoreWeave, and they're doing incredibly well. But you're seeing the regional GPU specialists -- service providers all over the world now, and -- and -- and because they all recognize the same thing, that the best way to invest your capital going forward is to put it into accelerated computing and generative AI. We're also seeing that -- that enterprises want to do that. But in order for enterprises to do it, you have to support the management system, the operating system, the security, and software -- software-defined data center approach of enterprises, and that's called VMware. And we've been working several years with VMware to make it possible for VMware to support, not just the virtualization of CPUs, but the virtualization of GPUs as well as the distributed computing capabilities of GPUs, supporting NVIDIA's BlueField for high-performance networking. And all of the generative AI libraries that we've been working on is now going to be offered as a special SKU by VMware's sales force, which is, as we all know, quite large because they reach some several hundred thousand VMware customers around the world. And this new SKU is going to be called VMware Private AI Foundation. And -- and this will be a new SKU that makes it possible for enterprises. And in combination with HPE, Dell, and Lenovo's new server offerings based on L40S, any -- any enterprise could have a state-of-the-art AI data center and be able to engage generative AI. And so, I think the -- the -- the answer to -- to that question, it's hard to predict exactly what's going to happen quarter to quarter. But I think the trend is very very clear now that we're seeing a platform shift. Operator Next, we'll go to Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

Can you talk about the attach rate of your networking solutions to your -- to -- to the compute that you're shipping?

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,19,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Well, working backwards, we don't use that to prioritize the allocation of our GPUs. We let customers decide what networking they would like to use. And for the customers that are building very large infrastructure, InfiniBand is, you know, I hate to say it, kind of a no-brainer. And the reason for that, because -- because the efficiency of InfiniBand is so significant. You know, some 10, 15, 20% higher throughput for $1 billion infrastructure translates to enormous savings. Basically, the networking is free. And so, if you have a -- a single application, if you will, infrastructure or it's largely dedicated to large language models or large AI systems, InfiniBand is really -- really a terrific choice. However, if you're -- if you're hosting for a lot of different users and -- and Ethernet is really important to the way you manage your data center, we have -- we have an excellent solution there that we just recently announced and it's called Spectrum X, where we're going to bring the capabilities, if you will, not all of it, but -- but some of it of the capabilities of InfiniBand, to Ethernet so that we can -- we can also, within the -- the environment of Ethernet, allow you to -- enable you to get excellent generative AI capabilities. So, Spectrum X is -- is just ramping now. It requires BlueField-3 and supports both our Spectrum-2 and Spectrum-3 Ethernet switches. And the additional performance is really spectacular. And, you know, BlueField-3 makes it possible and a whole bunch of software that goes along with it. BlueField -- BlueField, as all of you know, is -- is a project really dear to my heart. And it's -- it's off to just a tremendous start. I think it's a home run. This is the -- the concept of -- of in-network computing, and putting a lot of software in the computing fabric is being realized with -- with BlueField-3. And it is going to be a home run.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,21,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- DGX Cloud's strategy, let me start there. DGX Cloud's strategy is to -- to achieve several things: number one, to enable a really close partnership between us and the world's CSPs. We -- we recognize that -- that many of our -- we work with some 30,000 companies around the world, 15,000 of them are start-ups, thousands of them are generative AI companies. And the fastest-growing segment, of course, is generative AI. We're working with all of -- all of the world's AI start-ups. And -- and -- and ultimately, they would like to be able to land in one of the world's leading clouds. And -- and so, we -- we built DGX Cloud as a footprint inside the world's leading clouds so that we could simultaneously work with all of our AI partners and help land them in -- easily in one of our cloud partners. The second benefit is that it allows our CSPs and ourselves to work really closely together to improve the performance of hyperscale clouds, which is historically designed for multi-tenancy and not designed for high-performance distributed computing like generative AI. And so, to be able to work closely architecturally to -- to have our engineers work hand in hand to improve the networking performance and the computing performance has been really powerful, really terrific. And then, thirdly, of course, Nvidia uses very large infrastructures ourselves, and -- and our self-driving car team, our Nvidia research team, our generative AI team, our language model team. You know, the amount of infrastructure that we need is quite -- quite significant. And none of our -- none of our optimizing compilers are possible without our DGX systems. Even compilers these days require AI, and optimizing software and infrastructure software requires AI to -- to even develop. It's been well publicized that our engineering uses AI to design our chips. And so -- so, the internal -- our own consumption of AI, robotics team, so and so forth; Omniverse team, so on and so forth, all needs AI, and so -- all right? So, our -- our internal consumption is quite large as well, and we land that in DGX Cloud. And so, DFX Cloud has multiple -- multiple use cases, multiple drivers, and it's been off to an -- just an enormous success. Our -- our -- our CSPs love it. The developers love it. And our own internal engineers are clamoring to have more of it. And it's a great way for us to engage and work closely with all of the AI ecosystem around the world.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/08/23/nvidia-nvda-q2-2024-earnings-call-transcript/

Remember, software is a part of almost all of our products, whether they are data center products, GPUs, systems, or any of our products within gaming and our future automotive products. You're correct, we're also selling it in a stand-alone business. And that stand-alone software continues to grow, where we are providing both the software, services, upgrades across there as well. Now, we're seeing, at this point, probably hundreds of millions of dollars annually for our software business. And we are looking at NVIDIA AI Enterprise to be included with many of the products that we're selling, such as our DGX, such as our PCIe versions of our H100. And I think we're going to see more availability even with our CSP marketplaces. So, we're off to a great start, and I do believe we'll see this continue to grow going forward.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 23, 2023","June 30, 2023.",1,23,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- A new computing era has begun. The industry is simultaneously going through two platform transitions: accelerated computing and generative AI. Data centers are making a platform shift from general-purpose to accelerated computing. The trillion dollars of global data centers will transition to accelerated computing to achieve an order of magnitude better performance, energy efficiency, and cost. Accelerated computing enabled generative AI, which is now driving a platform shift in software and enabling new, never-before-possible applications. Together, accelerated computing and generative AI are driving a broad-based computer industry platform shift. Our demand is tremendous. We are significantly expanding our production capacity. Supply will substantially increase for the rest of this year and next year. Nobody has been preparing for this for over two decades and has created a new computing platform that the world's industry -- world's industries can build upon. What makes them so special are, one, architecture. Nvidia accelerates everything from data processing, training inference every AI model, real-time speech-to-computer vision, and giant recommenders to vector databases. The performance and versatility of our architecture translates to the lowest data center TCO, and best energy efficiency. Two, install base. Nvidia has hundreds of millions of CUDA-compatible GPUs worldwide. Developers need a large install base to reach end users and grow their business. Nvidia is the developer's preferred platform. More developers create more applications that make Nvidia more valuable for customers. Three, reach. Nvidia's in cloud's enterprise data centers, industrial edge, PCs, workstations, instruments, and robotics. Each has fundamentally unique computing models and ecosystems. System suppliers like OEMs -- computer OEMs can confidently invest in Nvidia because we offer significant market demand and reach. Scale and velocity. Nvidia has achieved significant -- significant scale and is 100% invested in accelerated computing and generative AI. Our ecosystem partners can trust that we have the expertise, focus, and scale to deliver a strong roadmap and reach to help them grow. We are accelerating because of the additive results of these capabilities. We're upgrading and adding new products about every six months versus every two years to address the expanding universe of generative AI. While we increase the output of H100 for training and inference of large language models, we're ramping up our new L40S universal GPU for scale -- for cloud scale-out and enterprise servers. Spectrum X, which consists of our Ethernet switch, BlueField-3, supernet, and software helps customers who want the best possible AI performance on Ethernet infrastructures. Customers are already working on next-generation, accelerated computing and generative AI with our Grace Hopper. We're extending NVIDIA AI to the world's enterprises that demand generative AI but with the model privacy, security, and sovereignty. Together with the world's leading enterprise IT companies, Accenture, Adobe, Getty, Hugging Face, Snowflake, ServiceNow, VMware, and WPP; and our enterprise system partners, Dell, HPE, and Lenovo, we are bringing generative AI to the world's enterprise. We're building NVIDIA Omniverse to digitalize and enable the world's multi-trillion-dollar heavy industries to use generative AI to automate how they build and operate physical assets and achieve greater productivity. Generative AI starts in the cloud, but the most significant opportunities are in the world's largest industries where companies can realize trillions of dollars of productivity gains. It is an exciting time for Nvidia, our customers, partners, and the entire ecosystem to drive this generational shift in computing. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,1,Toshi Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Good afternoon. Thank you so much for taking the question, and congrats on the strong results and incredible outlook. Just one question on data center. Colette, you mentioned the vast majority of the sequential increase in revenue this quarter will come from data center. I was curious what the construct is there, if you can speak to what the key drivers are from April to July. And perhaps more importantly, you talked about visibility into the second half of the year. I'm guessing it's more of a supply problem at this point. What kind of sequential growth beyond the July quarter can your supply chain support at this point? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,2,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- OK. So, a lot of different questions there, so let me see if I can start, and I'm sure Jensen will have some following-up comments. So, when we talk about our sequential growth that were expected between Q1 and Q2, our generative AI, large language models are driving this surge in demand. And it's broad-based across both our consumer Internet companies, our CSPs, our enterprises, and our AI start-ups. It is also interest in both of our architectures, both of our Hopper latest architecture, as well as our Ampere architecture. This is not surprising as we generally often sell both of our architectures at the same time. This is also a key area where deep recommendators are driving growth. And we also expect to see growth both in our computing, as well as in our networking business. So, those are some of the key things that we have baked in when we think about the guidance that we have provided to Q2. We also surfaced in our opening remarks that we are working on both supply today for this quarter, but we have also procured a substantial amount of supply for the second half. We have some significant supply chain flow to serve our significant customer demand that we see. And this is demand that we see across a wide range of different customers. They are building platforms for some of the largest enterprises but also setting things up at the CSPs and the large consumer internet companies. So, we have visibility right now for our data center demand that has probably extended out a few quarters. And this led us to working on quickly procuring that substantial supply for the second half. I'm going to pause there and see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,3,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I thought that was great, Colette. Thank you.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,4,C.J. Muse,Evercore ISI -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You know, I guess with data center essentially doubling quarter on quarter, two natural kind of questions that relate to one another come to mind. Number one, where are we in terms of driving acceleration into servers to support AI? And as part of that, as you deal with longer cycle times with TSMC and your other partners, how are you thinking about managing their commitments there with where you want to manage your lead times in the coming years to best kind of match that supply and demand? Thanks so much.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,5,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, C.J. Thanks for the question. I'll start backwards. The -- remember, we were in full production of both Ampere and Hopper when the ChatGPT moment came. And it helped everybody crystallize how to transition from the technology of large language models to a product and service based on a chatbot. The integration of guardrails and alignment systems with reinforcement learning from human feedback, knowledge vector databases for proprietary knowledge, connection to search, all of that came together in a really wonderful way. And it's -- the reason why I call it the iPhone moment, all the technology came together and helped everybody realize what an amazing product it can be and what capabilities it can have. And so, we were already in full production. NVIDIA's supply chain flow and our supply chain is very significant, as you know. And we build supercomputers in volume, and these are giant systems, and we build them in volume. It includes, of course, the GPUs. But on our GPUs, the system boards have 35,000 other components. And the networking and the fiber optics and the incredible transceivers and the NICs, the SmartNICs, the switches, all of that has to come together in order for us to stand up a data center. And so, we were already in full production when that moment came. We had to really significantly increase our procurement substantially for the second half, as Colette said. Now, let me talk about the bigger picture and why the entire world's data centers are moving toward accelerated computing. It's been known for some time, and you've heard me talk about it, that accelerated computing is a full stack problem but -- is full stack challenged. But if you could successfully do it in a large number of application domain that's taken us 15 years, it's sufficiently that almost the entire data centers' major applications could be accelerated, you could reduce the amount of energy consumed and the amount of cost for our data center substantially by an order of magnitude. It costs a lot of money to do it because you have to do all the software and everything, and you have to build all the systems and so on and so forth. But we've been at it for 15 years. And what happened is when generative AI I came along, it triggered a killer app for this computing platform that's been in preparation for some time. And so, now, we see ourselves in two simultaneous transitions: the world's $1 trillion data center is nearly populated entirely by CPUs today. And $1 trillion is $250 billion a year. It's growing, of course. But over the last four years, call it $1 trillion worth of infrastructure installed, and it's all completely based on CPUs and dumb NICs. It's basically unaccelerated. In the future, it's fairly clear now with this -- with generative AI becoming the primary workload of most of the world's data centers generating information, it is very clear now that -- and the fact that accelerated computing is so energy-efficient, that the budget of a data center will shift very dramatically toward accelerated computing, and you're seeing that now. We're going through that moment right now as we speak while the world's data center capex budget is limited. But at the same time, we're seeing incredible orders to retool the world's data centers. And so, I think you're starting -- you're seeing the beginning of, call it, a 10-year transition to basically recycle or reclaim the world's data centers and build it out as accelerated computing. You'll have a pretty dramatic shift in the spend of a data center from traditional computing and to accelerate computing with SmartNICs, smart switches, of course, GPUs and the workload is going to be predominantly generative AI. Operator OK. We'll move to our next question, Vivek Arya with BofA Securities.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,6,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for the question. I just wanted to clarify, does visibility mean data center sales can continue to grow sequentially in Q3 and Q4, or do they sustain at Q2 level? So, I just wanted to clarify that. And then, Jensen, my question is that given this very strong demand environment, what does it do to the competitive landscape? Does it invite more competition in terms of custom ASICs? Does it invite more competition in terms of other GPU solutions or other kinds of solutions? What -- how do you see the competitive landscape change over the next two to three years?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,7,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Vivek. Thanks for the question. Let me see if I can add a little bit more color. We believe that the supply that we will have for the second half of the year will be substantially larger than H1. So, we are expecting, not only the demand that we just saw in this last quarter, the demand that we have in Q2 for our forecast, but also planning on seeing something in the second half of the year. We just have to be careful here, but we're not here to guide on the second half. But yes, we do plan a substantial increase in the second half compared to the first half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Regarding competition, we have competition from every direction, start-ups, really, really well funded and innovative start-ups, countless of them all over the world. We have competitions from existing semiconductor companies. We have competition from CSPs with internal projects, and many of you know about most of these. And so, we're mindful of competition all the time, and we get competition all the time. NVIDIA's value proposition at the core is we are the lowest cost solution. We're the lowest TCO solution. And the reason for that is because accelerated computing is two things that I talked about often, which is it's a full stack problem. It's a full stack challenge. You have to engineer all of the software and all the libraries and all the algorithms, integrate them into and optimize the frameworks and optimize it for the architecture of not just one chip but the architecture of an entire data center all the way into the frameworks, all the way into the models. And the amount of engineering and distributed computing -- fundamental computer science work is really quite extraordinary. It is the hardest computing as we know. And so, number one, it's a full stack challenge, and you have to optimize it across the whole thing and across just a mind-blowing number of stacks. We have 400 acceleration libraries. As you know, the amount of libraries and frameworks that we accelerate is pretty mind-blowing. The second part is that generative AI is a large-scale problem and it's a data center scale problem. It's another way of thinking that the computer is the data center or the data center is the computer. It's not the chip, it's the data center. And it's never happened like this before. And in this particular environment, your networking operating system, your distributed computing engines, your understanding of the architecture of the networking gear, the switches, and the computing systems, the computing fabric, that entire system is your computer. And that's what you're trying to operate. And so, in order to get the best performance, you have to understand full stack and understand data center scale. And that's what accelerated computing is. The second thing is that utilization, which talks about the amount of the types of applications that you can accelerate and the versatility of your architecture keeps that utilization high. If you can do one thing and do one thing only incredibly fast, then your data center is largely underutilized, and it's hard to scale that out. NVIDIA's universal GPU, the fact that we accelerate so many of these stacks, makes our utilization incredibly high. And so, number one is steer put, and that's software-intensive problems and data center architecture problem. The second is digitalization versatility problem. And the third, it's just data center expertise. We've built five data centers of our own, and we've helped companies all over the world build data centers. And we integrate our architecture into all the world's clouds. From the moment of delivery of the product to the standing up and the deployment, the time to operations of a data center is measured not -- it can -- if you're not good at it and not proficient at it, it could take months. Standing up a supercomputer -- let's see. Some of the largest supercomputers in the world were installed about 1.5 years ago, and now they're coming online. And so, it's not unheard of to see a delivery to operations of about a year. Our delivery to operations is measured in weeks. And that's -- we've taken data centers and supercomputers, and we've turned it into products. And the expertise of the team in doing that is incredible. And so, our value proposition is in the final analysis. All of this technology translates into infrastructure, the highest throughput and the lowest possible cost. And so, I think our market is, of course, very, very competitive, very large, but the challenge is really, really great. Operator Next, we go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

Thank you for taking a question, and congrats on the quarter. As we kind of think about unpacking the various different growth drivers of the data center business going forward, I'm curious, Colette, of just how we should think about the monetization effect of software considering that the expansion of your cloud service agreements continues to grow. I'm curious of what -- where do you think we're at in terms of that approach, in terms of the AI enterprise software suite and other drivers of software-only revenue going forward?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/

Software is really important to our accelerated platforms. Not only do we have a substantial amount of software that we are including in our newest architecture and essentially all products that we have, we're now with many different models to help customers start their work in generative AI and accelerated computing. So, anything that we have here from DGX Cloud on providing those services, helping them build models, or, as you've discussed, the importance of NVIDIA AI Enterprise, essentially, that operating system for AI, so all things should continue to grow as we go forward, both the architecture and the infrastructure, as well as the -- both availability of the software and our ability to monetize that with it as well. I'll turn it over to Jensen if needs to comment.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,11,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. We can see in real time the growth of generative AI in CSPs, both for training the models, refining the models, as well as deploying the models. As Colette said earlier, inference is now a major driver of accelerated computing because generative AI is used so capably in so many applications already. There are two segments that require a new stack of software, and the two segments are enterprise and industrials. Enterprise requires a new stack of software because many enterprises need to have all the capabilities that we've talked about, whether it's large language models, the ability to adapt them for your proprietary use case, and your proprietary data and alignment to your own principles and your own operating domains. You want to have the ability to be able to do that in a high-performance computing sandbox, and we call that DGX Cloud and -- to create that model. Then, you want to deploy your chatbot or your AI in any cloud because you have services and you have agreements with multiple cloud vendors and depending on the applications, you might deploy it on various clouds. And for the enterprise, we have NVIDIA AI Foundations for helping you create custom models, and we have NVIDIA AI Enterprise. NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the only accelerated stack -- GPU accelerated stack in the world that is enterprise safe and enterprise supported. There are constant patching that you have to do. There are 4,000 different packages that build up NVIDIA AI Enterprise and represents the operating engine -- end-to-end operating engine of the entire AI workflow. It's the only one of its kind from data ingestion, data processing. Obviously, in order to train an AI model, you have a lot of data you have to process and package up and curate and align. And there's just a whole bunch of stuff that you have to do to the data to prepare it for training. That amount of data could consume some 40%, 50%, 60% of your computing time. And so, data processing is a very big deal. And then, the second aspect of it is training the model, refining the model. And the third is deploying model for inferencing.NVIDIA AI Enterprise supports and patches and security patches continuously all of those 4,000 packages of software. And for an enterprise that wants to deploy their engines just like they want to deploy Red Hat Linux, this is incredibly complicated software. In order to deploy that in every cloud and as well as on-prem, it has to be secure. It has to be supported. And so, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is the second part. The third is Omniverse. Just as people are starting to realize that you need to align an AI to ethics, the same for robotics. You need to align the AI for physics, and aligning an AI for ethics includes a technology called reinforcement learning human feedback. In the case of industrial applications and robotics, it's reinforcement learning Omniverse feedback. And Omniverse is a vital engine for software-defined and robotic applications and industries. And so, Omniverse also needs to be a cloud service platform. And so, our software stack, the three software stacks, AI Foundations, AI Enterprise, and Omniverse, runs in all of the world's clouds that we have partnerships, DGX Cloud partnerships with. Azure, we have partnerships on both AI, as well as Omniverse. With GCP and Oracle, we have great partnerships in DGX Cloud for AI, and AI Enterprise is integrated into all three of them. And so, I think the -- in order for us to extend the reach of AI beyond the cloud and into the world's enterprise and into the world's industries, you need two new types of -- you need new software stacks in order to make that happen. And by putting it in the cloud, integrated into the world CSP clouds, it's a great way for us to partner with the sales and the marketing team and the leadership team of all the cloud vendors.

So, the question, first, is, Jensen, on the InfiniBand versus ethernet argument, can you sort of speak to that debate and maybe how you see it playing out? I know you need the low latency of InfiniBand for AI. But can you sort of talk about the attach rate of your InfiniBand solutions to what you're shipping on the core compute side and maybe whether that's similarly crowding out ethernet like you are with -- on the compute side?

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,15,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- InfiniBand and ethernet are -- target different applications in a data center. They both have their place. InfiniBand had a record quarter. We're going to have a giant record year. And InfiniBand has a really -- NVIDIA's Quantum InfiniBand has an exceptional road map. It's going to be really incredible. The two networks are very different. InfiniBand is designed for an AI factory, if you will. If that data center is running a few applications for a few people for a specific use case and is doing it continuously, and that infrastructure costs you, pick a number, $500 million. The difference between InfiniBand and ethernet could be 15%, 20% in overall throughput. And if you spent $500 million on an infrastructure and the difference is 10% to 20%, and it's $100 million, InfiniBand's basically free. That's the reason why people use it. InfiniBand is effectively free. The difference in data center throughput is just -- it's too great to ignore. And you're using it for that one application. And so -- however, if your data center is a cloud data center and it's multi-tenant, it's a bunch of little jobs, a bunch of little jobs and is shared by millions of people, then ethernet is really the right answer. There's a new segment in the middle where the cloud is becoming a generative AI cloud. It's not an AI factory per se, but it's still a multi-tenant cloud, but it wants to run generative AI workloads. This new segment is a wonderful opportunity. And at COMPUTEX -- I referred to it at the last GTC.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,16,Stacy Rasgon,Bernstein Research -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I had a question on inference versus training for generative AI. So, you're talking about inference as being a very large opportunity. I guess two subparts of that. Is that because inference basically scales with like the usage versus like training is more of a one and done? And can you give us some sort of -- even if it's just like qualitatively, like do you think inference is bigger than training or vice versa? Like if it's bigger, how much bigger? Is it like the opportunity, is it 5x? Is it 10x? Is there anything you can give us on those two workloads within generative AI, would be helpful?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I'll work backwards. You're never done with training. You're always -- every time you deploy, you're collecting new data. When you collect new data, you train with the new data. And so, you're never done training. You're never done producing and processing a vector database that augments the large language model. You're never done with vectorizing all of the collected structured, unstructured data that you have. And so, whether you're building a recommender system, a large language model, a vector database, these are probably the three major applications of -- the three core engines, if you will, of the future of computing, as well as a bunch of other stuff. But obviously, these are very -- three very important ones. They are always, always running. You're going to see that more and more companies realize they have a factory for intelligence -- an intelligence factory. And in that particular case, it's largely dedicated to training and processing data and vectorizing data and learning representation of the data, so on and so forth. The inference part of it are APIs that are either open APIs that can be connected to all kinds of applications, APIs that are integrated into workflows but APIs of all kinds. There will be hundreds of APIs in a company. Some of them, they built themselves. Some of them, part that -- many of them could come from companies like ServiceNow and Adobe that we're partnering with in AI Foundations. And they'll create a whole bunch of generative AI APIs that companies can then connect into their workflows or use as an application. And, of course, there'll be a whole bunch of internet service companies. And so, I think you're seeing for the very first time, simultaneously, a very significant growth in the segment of AI factories, as well as a market that -- a segment that really didn't exist before but now it's growing exponentially, practically by the week, for AI inference with APIs. The simple way to think about it in the end is that the world has a $1 trillion of data center installed, and it used to be 100% CPUs. In the future, we know -- we've heard it in enough places, and I think this year's ISC keynote was actually about the end of Moore's Law. We've seen it in a lot of places now that you can't reasonably scale out data centers with general purpose computing and that accelerated computing is the path forward. And now, it's got a killer app. It's called generative AI. And so, the easiest way to think about that is your $1 trillion infrastructure. Every quarter's capital, capex budget would lean very heavily into generative AI, into accelerated computing infrastructure, everywhere from the number of GPUs that would be used in the capex budget to the accelerated switches and accelerated networking chips that connect them all. The easiest way to think about that is, over the next four, five, 10 years, most of that $1 trillion and then compensating, adjusting for all the growth in data center still, it will be largely generative AI. And so, that's probably the easiest way to think about that, and that's training as well as inference. Operator Good. Next, we'll go to Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,18,Joe Moore,Morgan Stanley -- Analyst,analyst,-- Great. Thank you. I wanted to follow up on that in terms of the focus on inference. It's pretty clear that this is a really big opportunity around large language models. But the cloud customers are also talking about trying to reduce cost per query by very significant amounts. Can you talk about the ramifications of that for you guys? Is that where some of the specialty inference products that you launched at GTC come in? And just how are you going to help your customers get the cost per query down?,https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,19,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. That's a great question. Whether you're -- whether -- you start by building a large language model, and you use that large language model, very large version, and you could distill them into medium, small, and tiny size. And the tiny sized ones, you could put in your phone and your PC and so on and so forth. And they all have good -- they all have -- it seems surprising, but they all can do the same thing. But obviously, the zero shot or the generalizability of the large language model, the biggest one is much more versatile, and it can do a lot more amazing things. And the large one would teach the smaller ones how to be good AIs, and so you use the large one to generate prompts to align the smaller ones and so on and so forth. And so, you start by building very large ones, and then you also have to train a whole bunch of smaller ones. That's exactly the reason why we have so many different sizes of our inference. You saw that I announced L4, L40, H100 NVL, which also has H100. And then, it has -- and then, we have H100 HGX, and then we have H100 multinode with NVLink. And so, there's a -- you could have model sizes of any kind that you like. The other thing that's important is these are models, but they're connected ultimately to applications. And the applications could have image in, video out, video in, text out, image in, proteins out, text in, 3D out, video in, in the future, 3D graphics out. So, the input and the output requires a lot of pre and postprocessing. The pre and postprocessing can't be ignored. And this is one of the things that most of the specialized chip arguments fall apart. And it's because the length -- the model itself is only, call it, 25% of the data -- of the overall processing of inference. The rest of it is about preprocessing, postprocessing, security, decoding, all kinds of things like that. And so, I think the -- we -- the multi-modality aspect of inference, the multidiversity of inference that it's going to be done in the cloud on-prem, it's going to be done in multi-cloud. That's the reason why we have AI Enterprise in all the clouds. It's going to be done on-prem. It's the reason why we have a great partnership with Dell we just announced the other day called Project Helix. That's going to be integrated into third-party services. That's the reason why we have a great partnership with ServiceNow and Adobe because they're going to be creating a whole bunch of generative AI capabilities. And so, there's a -- the diversity and the reach of generative AI is so broad, you need to have some very fundamental capabilities like what I just described in order to really address the whole space of it.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,20,Harlan Sur,JPMorgan Chase and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Good afternoon, and congratulations on the strong results and execution. I really appreciate more of the focus or some of the focus today on your networking products. I mean, it's really an integral part to sort of maximize the full performance of your compute platforms. I think your data center networking business is driving about $1 billion of revenues per quarter, plus or minus. That's 2.5x growth from three years ago, right, when you guys acquired Mellanox, so very strong growth. But given the very high attach of your InfiniBand ethernet solutions, your accelerated compute platforms, is the networking run rate stepping up in line with your compute shipments? And then, what is the team doing to further unlock more networking bandwidth going forward just to keep pace with the significant increase in compute complexity, data sets, requirements for lower latency, better traffic predictability and so on?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,21,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Harlan, I really appreciate that. Nearly everybody who thinks about AI, they think about that chip, that accelerator chip. And in fact, this is the whole point nearly completely. And I've mentioned before that accelerated computing is about the stack, about the software. And networking, remember, we announced very, very early on this networking stack called DOCA, and we have an acceleration library called Magnum IO. These two pieces of software are some of the crown jewels of our company. Nobody ever talks about it because it's hard to understand, but it makes it possible for us to connect tens of thousands of GPUs. How do you connect tens of thousands of GPUs if the operating system of the data center, which is the infrastructure, is not insanely great? And so, that's the reason why we're so obsessed about networking in the company. And one of the great things that we have, we have Mellanox, as you know quite well, was the world's highest performance and the unambiguous leader in high-performance networking. It's the reason why our two companies are together. You also see that our network expands starting from NVLink, which is a computing fabric with really super low latency, and it communicates using memory references, not network packaged. And then, we take NVLink. We connect it inside multiple GPUs, and I've described going beyond the GPU. And I'll talk a lot more about that at COMPUTEX in a few days. And then that gets connected to InfiniBand, which includes the NIC and the SmartNIC, BlueField-3 that we're in full production with and the switches. All of the fiber optics that are optimized end to end, these things are running at incredible line rates. And then, beyond that, if you want to connect the smart AI factory -- this AI factory into your computing fabric, we have a brand-new type of ethernet that we'll be announcing at COMPUTEX. And so the -- this whole area of the computing fabric extending -- connecting all of these GPUs and computing units together all the way through the networking, through the switches, the software stack is insanely complicated. And so, we're -- I'm delighted you understand it, and -- but we don't break it out particularly because we think of the whole thing as a computing platform as it should be. We sell it to all of the world's data centers as components so that they can integrate it into whatever style or architecture that they would like and we can still run our software stack. That's the reason why we break it up. It's way more complicated the way that we do it, but it makes it possible for NVIDIA's computing architecture to be integrated into anybody's data center in the world from cloud of all different kinds to on-prem of all different kinds, all the way out to the edge to 5G. And so, this way of doing it is really, really complicated, but it gives us incredible reach. Operator And our last question will come from Matt Ramsay with TD Cowen.

Congratulations, Jensen, and to the whole team. One of the things I wanted to dig into a little bit is the DGX Cloud offering. You guys have been working on this for some time behind the scenes, where you sell in the hardware to your hyperscale partners and then lease it back for your own business. And the rest of us kind of found out about it publicly a few months ago. And as we look forward over the next number of quarters, as Colette discussed, the high visibility in the data center business, maybe you could talk a little bit about the mix you're seeing of hyperscale customers buying for their own first-party internal workloads versus their own sort of third party, their own customers versus what of that big upside in data center going forward is systems that you're selling in with potential to support your DGX Cloud offerings and what you've learned since you've launched it about the potential of that business. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,23,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Matt. It's -- without being too specific about numbers, but the ideal scenario, the ideal mix is something like 10% NVIDIA DGX Cloud and 90% the CSPs' clouds. And the reason -- and our DGX Cloud is the NVIDIA stack. It's the pure NVIDIA stack. It is architected the way we like and achieves the best possible performance. It gives us the ability to partner very deeply with the CSPs to create the highest-performing infrastructure, number one. Number two, it allows us to partner with the CSPs to create markets. Like for example, we're partnering with Azure to bring Omniverse Cloud to the world's industries. And the world has never had a system like that, the computing stack with all the generative AI stuff and all the 3D stuff and the physics stuff, incredibly large database and really high-speed networks and low-latency networks. That kind of a virtual -- industrial virtual world has never existed before. And so, we partnered with Microsoft to create Omniverse Cloud inside Azure Cloud. And so, it allows us, number two, to create new applications together and develop new markets together. And we go to market as one team. And we benefit by getting customers on our computing platform, and they benefit by having us in their cloud, number one. But number two, the amount of data and services and security services and all of the amazing things that Azure and GCP and OCI have, they can instantly have access to that through Omniverse Cloud. And so, it's a huge win-win. And for the customers, the way that NVIDIA's cloud works for these early applications, they could do it anywhere. So, one standard stack runs in all the clouds. And if they would like to take their software and run it on the CSP's cloud themselves and manage it themselves, we're delighted by that because NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA AI Foundations, and long term, this is going to take a little longer, but NVIDIA Omniverse will run in the CSP's clouds. OK? So, our goal really is to drive architecture, to partner deeply in creating new markets and the new applications that we're doing and provide our customers with the flexibilities to run NVIDIA everywhere, including on-prem. And so, that -- those were the primary reasons for it. And it's worked out incredibly. Our partnership with the three CSPs and that we currently have DGX Cloud in and their sales force and marketing teams, their leadership teams is really quite spectacular. It works great. Operator Thank you. I'll now turn it back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/05/24/nvidia-nvda-q1-2024-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 24, 2023","April 30, 2023.",1,24,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The computer industry is going through two simultaneous transitions, accelerated computing and generative AI. CPU scaling has slowed, yet computing demand is strong, and now, with generative AI, supercharged. Accelerated computing, a full stack and data center scale approach that NVIDIA pioneered is the best path forward. There's $1 trillion installed in the global data center infrastructure based on the general purpose computing method of the last era. Companies are now racing to deploy accelerated computing for the generative AI era. Over the next decade, most of the world's data centers will be accelerated. We are significantly increasing our supply to meet their surging demand. Large language models can learn information encoded in many forms. Guided by large language models, generative AI models can generate amazing content with models to fine-tune, guardrail, align to guiding principles. And ground -- ground to facts, generative AI is emerging from labs and is on its way to industrial applications. As we scale with cloud and internet service providers, we are also building platforms for the world's largest enterprises. Whether within one of our CSP partners or on-prem with Dell Helix, whether on a leading enterprise platform like ServiceNow and Adobe or bespoke with NVIDIA AI Foundations, we can help enterprises leverage their domain expertise and data to harness generative AI securely and safely. We are ramping a wave of products in the coming quarters, including H100, our Grace and Grace Hopper Superchips and our BlueField-3 and Spectrum-4 networking platform. They are all in production. They will help deliver data center scale computing that is also energy-efficient and sustainable computing. Join us next week at COMPUTEX, and we'll show you what's next. Thank you.

Clearly, on this call, a key focal point is going to be the monetization effect of your software and cloud strategy. I think as we look at it, I think, straight up, the enterprise AI software suite, I think, is priced at around $6,000 per CPU socket. I think you've got pricing metrics a little bit higher for the cloud consumption model.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,3,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. First of all, taking a step back, NVIDIA AI is essentially the operating system of AI systems today. It starts from data processing to learning, training, to validations, to inference. And so this body of software is completely accelerated. It runs in every cloud. It runs on-prem. And it supports every framework, every model that we know of, and it's accelerated everywhere. By using NVIDIA AI, your entire machine learning operations is more efficient, and it is more cost effective. You save money by using accelerated software. Our announcement today of putting NVIDIA's infrastructure and have it be hosted from within the world's leading cloud service providers accelerates the enterprise's ability to utilize NVIDIA AI enterprise. It accelerates people's adoption of this machine-learning pipeline, which is not for the faint of heart. It is a very extensive body of software. It is not deployed in enterprises broadly, but we believe that by hosting everything in the cloud, from the infrastructure through the operating system software, all the way through pretrained models, we can accelerate the adoption of generative AI in enterprises. And so we're excited about this new extended part of our business model. We really believe that it will accelerate the adoption of software.

Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if you meant data center could grow on a year-on-year basis also in Q1? And then Jensen, my main question kind of relate to two small related ones. The computing intensity for generative AI, if it is very high, does it limit the market size to just a handful of hyperscalers? And on the other extreme, if the market gets very large, then doesn't it attract more competition for NVIDIA from cloud ASICs or other accelerator options that are out there in the market?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,6,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Large language models are called large because they are quite large. However, remember that we've accelerated and advanced AI processing by a million x over the last decade. Moore's Law, in its best days, would have delivered 100x in a decade. By coming up with new processors, new systems, new interconnects, new frameworks and algorithms, and working with data scientists, AI researchers on new models, across that entire span, we've made large language model processing a million times faster, a million times faster. What would have taken a couple of months in the beginning, now it happens in about 10 days. And of course, you still need a large infrastructure. And even the large infrastructure, we're introducing Hopper, which, with its transformer engine, its new NVLink switches and its new InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second data rates, we're able to take another leap in the processing of large language models. And so I think the -- by putting NVIDIA's DGX supercomputers into the cloud with NVIDIA DGX cloud, we're going to democratize the access of this infrastructure, and with accelerated training capabilities, really make this technology and this capability quite accessible. So that's one thought. The second is the number of large language models or foundation models that have to be developed is quite large. Different countries with different cultures and its body of knowledge are different. Different fields, different domains, whether it's imaging or its biology or its physics, each one of them need their own domain of foundation models. With large language models, of course, we now have a prior that could be used to accelerate the development of all these other fields, which is really quite exciting. The other thing to remember is that the number of companies in the world have their own proprietary data. The most valuable data in the world are proprietary. And they belong to the company. It's inside their company. It will never leave the company. And that body of data will also be harnessed to train new AI models for the very first time. And so we -- our strategy and our goal is to put the DGX infrastructure in the cloud so that we can make this capability available to every enterprise, every company in the world who would like to create proprietary data and so -- proprietary models. The second thing about competition. We've had competition for a long time. Our approach, our computing architecture, as you know, is quite different on several dimensions. Number one, it is universal, meaning you could use it for training, you can use it for inference, you can use it for models of all different types. It supports every framework. It supports every cloud. It's everywhere. It's cloud to private cloud, cloud to on-prem. It's all the way out to the edge. It could be an autonomous system. This one architecture allows developers to develop their AI models and deploy it everywhere. The second very large idea is that no AI in itself is an application. There's a preprocessing part of it and a post-processing part of it to turn it into an application or service. Most people don't talk about the pre and post processing because it's maybe not as sexy and not as interesting. However, it turns out that preprocessing and post-processing oftentimes consumes half or two-thirds of the overall workload. And so by accelerating the entire end-to-end pipeline, from preprocessing, from data ingestion, data processing, all the way to the preprocessing all the way to post processing, we're able to accelerate the entire pipeline versus just accelerating half of the pipeline. The limit to speed up, even if you're instantly passed if you only accelerate half of the workload, is twice as fast. Whereas if you accelerate the entire workload, you could accelerate the workload maybe 10, 20, 50 times faster, which is the reason why when you hear about NVIDIA accelerating applications, you routinely hear 10x, 20x, 50x speed up. And the reason for that is because we accelerate things end to end, not just the deep learning part of it, but using CUDA to accelerate everything from end to end. And so I think the universality of our computing -- accelerated computing platform, the fact that we're in every cloud, the fact that we're from cloud to edge, makes our architecture really quite accessible and very differentiated in this way. And most importantly, to all the service providers, because of the utilization is so high, because you can use it to accelerate the end-to-end workload and get such a good throughput, our architecture is the lowest operating cost. It's not -- the comparison is not even close. So -- and yes, those are the two answers. Operator Your next question comes from the line of C.J. Muse with Evercore.

I guess, Jensen, you talked about ChatGPT as an inflection point kind of like the iPhone. And so curious, part A, how have your conversations evolved post ChatGPT with hyperscale and large-scale enterprises?

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- ChatGPT is a wonderful piece of work, and the team did a great job, OpenAI did a great job with it. They stuck with it. And the accumulation of all of the breakthroughs led to a service with a model inside that surprised everybody with its versatility and its capability. What people were surprised by, and this is in our -- and close within the industry is well understood. But the surprising capability of a single AI model that can perform tasks and skills that it was never trained to do. And for this language model to not just speak English, or can translate, of course, but not just speak human language, it can be prompted in human language, but output Python, output Cobalt, a language that very few people even remember, output Python for Blender, a 3D program. So it's a program that writes a program for another program. We now realize -- the world now realizes that maybe human language is a perfectly good computer programming language, and that we've democratized computer programming for everyone, almost anyone who could explain in human language a particular task to be performed. This new computer -- when I say new era of computing, this new computing platform, this new computer could take whatever your prompt is, whatever your human-explained request is, and translate it to a sequence of instructions that you process it directly, or it waits for you to decide whether you want to process it or not. And so this type of computer is utterly revolutionary in its application because it's democratized programming to so many people really has excited enterprises all over the world. Every single CSP, every single Internet service provider, and they're, frankly, every single software company, because of what I just explained, that this is an AI model that can write a program for any program. Because of that reason, everybody who develops software is either alerted or shocked into alert or actively working on something that is like ChatGPT to be integrated into their application or integrated into their service. And so this is, as you can imagine, utterly worldwide. The activity around the AI infrastructure that we build Hopper and the activity around inferencing using Hopper and Ampere to inference large language models, has just gone through the roof in the last 60 days. And so there's no question that whatever our views are of this year as we enter the year has been fairly, dramatically changed as a result of the last 60, 90 days.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,9,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I wanted to ask a couple of questions on the DGX Cloud. And I guess, we're all talking about the drivers of the services and the compute that you're going to host on top of these services with the different hyperscalers. But I think we've been kind of watching and wondering when your data center business might transition to more of a systems level business, meaning pairing and D-Link InfiniBand with your Hopper product, with your Grace product, and selling things more on a systems level. I wonder if you could step back, over the next two or three years, how do you think the mix of business in your data center segment evolves from maybe selling cards to systems and software? And what can that mean for the margins of that business over time? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,10,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. I appreciate the question. First of all, as you know, our data center business is a GPU business only in the context of a conceptual GPU because what we actually sell to the cloud service providers is a panel, a fairly large computing panel of eight Hoppers or eight Amperes that's connected with NVLink switches that are connected with NVLink. And so this board represents essentially one GPU. It's eight chips connected together into one GPU with a very high-speed chip-to-chip interconnect. And so we've been working on, if you will, multi-die computers for quite some time. And that is one GPU. So when we think about a GPU, we actually think about an HGX GPU, and that's 8 GPUs. We're going to continue to do that. And the thing that the cloud service providers are really excited about is by hosting our infrastructure for NVIDIA to offer because we have so many companies that we work directly with. We're working directly with 10,000 AI start-ups around the world, with enterprises in every industry. And all of those relationships today would really love to be able to deploy both into the cloud at least or into the cloud and on-prem and oftentimes multi-cloud. And so by having NVIDIA DGX and NVIDIA's infrastructure are full stack in their cloud, we're effectively attracting customers to the CSPs. This is a very, very exciting model for them. And they welcomed us with open arms. And we're going to be the best AI salespeople for the world's clouds. And for the customers, they now have an instantaneous infrastructure that is the most advanced. They have a team of people who are extremely good from the infrastructure to the acceleration software, the NVIDIA AI open operating system, all the way up to AI models. Within one entity, they have access to expertise across that entire span. And so this is a great model for customers. It's a great model for CSPs. And it's a great model for us. It lets us really run like the wind. As much as we will continue and continue to advance DGX AI supercomputers, it does take time to build AI supercomputers on-prem. It's hard no matter how you look at it. It takes time no matter how you look at it. And so now we have the ability to really prefetch a lot of that and get customers up and running as fast as possible. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,11,Timothy Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. Jensen, I had a question about what this all does to your TAM. Most of the focus right now is on text, but obviously, there are companies doing a lot of training on video and music. They're working on models there. And it seems like somebody who's training these big models has maybe, on the high end, at least 10,000 GPUs in the cloud that they've contracted and maybe tens of thousands of more to inference a widely deployed model. So it seems like the incremental TAM is easily in the several hundred thousands of GPUs and easily in the tens of billions of dollars. But I'm kind of wondering what this does to the TAM numbers you gave last year. I think you said $300 billion hardware TAM and $300 billion software TAM. So how do you kind of think about what the new TAM would be? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,12,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I think those numbers are really good anchor still. The difference is because of the, if you will, incredible capabilities and versatility of generative AI and all of the converging breakthroughs that happened toward the middle and the end of last year, we're probably going to arrive at that TAM sooner than later. There's no question that this is a very big moment for the computer industry. Every single platform change, every inflection point in the way that people develop computers happened because it was easier to use, easier to program and more accessible. This happened with the PC revolution. This happened with the Internet revolution. This happened with mobile cloud. Remember, mobile cloud, because of the iPhone and the App Store, 5 million applications and counting emerged. There weren't 5 million mainframe applications. There weren't 5 million workstation applications. There weren't 5 million PC applications. And because it was so easy to develop and deploy amazing applications part cloud, part on the mobile device and so easy to distribute because of app stores, the same exact thing is now happening to AI. In no computing era did one computing platform, ChatGPT, reached 150 million people in 60, 90 days. I mean, this is quite an extraordinary thing. And people are using it to create all kinds of things. And so I think that what you're seeing now is just a torrent of new companies and new applications that are emerging. There's no question this is, in every way, a new computing era. And so I think this -- the TAM that we explained and expressed, it really is even more realizable today and sooner than before.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,13,Stacy Rasgon,AllianceBernstein -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. I have a clarification and then a question both for Colette. The clarification, you said H100 revenue's higher than A100. Was that an overall statement? Or was that at the same point in time like after two-quarters of shipments? And then for my actual question. I wanted to ask about auto, specifically the Mercedes opportunity. The Mercedes had an event today, and they were talking about software revenues for their MB Drive that could be single digit or low billion euros by mid-decade and mid-billion euros by the end of the decade. And I know you guys were supposedly splitting the software revenues 50-50. Is that kind of the order of magnitude of software revenues from the Mercedes deal that you guys are thinking of and over that similar time frame? Is that how we should be modeling that? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,14,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Great. Thanks, Stacy, for the question. Let me first start with your question you had about H100 and A100. We began initial shipments of H100 back in Q3. It was a great start. Many of them began that process many quarters ago. And this was a time for us to get production level to them in Q3. So Q4 was an important time for us to see a great ramp of H100 that we saw. What that means is our H100 was the focus of many of our CSPs within Q4, and they were all wanting to get both get up and running in cloud instances. And so we actually saw less of A100 in Q4 of what we saw in H100 at a larger amount. We tend to continue to sell both architectures going forward, but just in Q4, it was a strong quarter for H100. Your additional questions that you had on Mercedes Benz. I'm very pleased with the joint connection that we have with them and the work. We've been working very diligently about getting ready to come to market. And you're right. They did talk about the software opportunity. They talked about their software opportunity in two phases, about what they can do with Drive as well as what they can also do with Connect. They extended out to a position of probably about 10 years looking at the opportunity that they see in front of us. So it aligns with what our thoughts are with a long-term partner of that and sharing that revenue over time.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,15,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- One of the things that, if I could add, Stacy, to say something about the wisdom of what Mercedes is doing. This is the only large luxury brand that has, across the board, from every -- from the entry all the way to the highest end of their luxury cars, to install every single one of them with a rich sensor set, every single one of them with an AI supercomputer, so that every future car in the Mercedes fleet will contribute to an installed base that could be upgradable and forever renewed for customers going forward. If you could just imagine what it looks like if the entire Mercedes fleet that is on the road today were completely programmable, that you can OTA, it would represent tens of millions of Mercedeses that would represent revenue-generating opportunity. And that's the vision that Ola has. And what they're building for, I think, it's going to be extraordinary. The large installed base of luxury cars that will continue to renew with -- for customers' benefits and also for revenue-generating benefits.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,16,Mark Lipacis,Jefferies -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thanks for taking my question. I think for you, Jensen, it seems like every year a new workload comes out and drives demand for your process or your ecosystem cycles. And if I think back facial recognition and then recommendation engines, natural language processing, Omniverse and now generative AI engines, can you share with us your view? Is this what we should expect going forward, like a brand-new workload that drives demand to the next level for your products? And the reason I ask is because I found it interesting your comments in your script where you mentioned that your kind of view about the demand that generative AI is going to drive for your products and now services is -- seems to be a lot, better than what you thought just over the last 90 days. So -- and to the extent that there's new workloads that you're working on or new applications that can drive next levels of demand, would you care to share with us a little bit of what you think could drive it past what you're seeing today? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, Mark. I really appreciate the question. First of all, I have new applications that you don't know about and new workloads that we've never shared that I would like to share with you at GTC. And so that's my hook to come to GTC, and I think you're going to be very surprised and quite delighted by the applications that we're going to talk about. Now there's a reason why it is the case that you're constantly hearing about new applications. The reason for that is, number one, NVIDIA is a multi-domain accelerated computing platform. It is not completely general purpose like a CPU because a CPU is 95%, 98% control functions and only 2% mathematics, which makes it completely flexible. We're not that way. We're an accelerated computing platform that works with the CPU that offloads the really heavy computing units, things that could be highly, highly paralyzed to offload them. But we're multi-domain. We could do particle systems. We could do fluids. We could do neurons. And we can do computer graphics. We can do race. There are all kinds of different applications that we can accelerate, number one. Number two, our installed base is so large. This is the only accelerated computing platform, the only platform. Literally, the only one that is architecturally compatible across every single cloud from PCs to workstations, gamers to cars to on-prem. Every single computer is architecturally compatible, which means that a developer who developed something special would seek out our platform because they like the reach. They like the universal reach. They like the acceleration, number one. They like the ecosystem of programming tools and the ease of using it and the fact that they have so many people they can reach out to, to help them. There are millions of CUDA experts around the world, software all accelerated, tool all accelerated. And then very importantly, they like the reach. They like the fact that you can see -- they can reach so many users after they develop the software. And it is the reason why we just keep attracting new applications. And then finally, this is a very important point. Remember, the rate of CPU computing advance has slowed tremendously. And whereas back in the first 30 years of my career, at 10x in performance at about the same power every five years and then 10x every five years. That rate of continued advance has slowed. At a time when people still have really, really urging applications that they would like to bring to the world, and they can't afford to do that with the power keep going up. Everybody needs to be sustainable. You can't continue to consume power. By accelerating it, we can decrease the amount of power you use for any workload. And so all of these multitude of reasons is really driving people to use accelerated computing, and we keep discovering new exciting applications.

Colette, I have a question on data center. You saw some weakness on build plan in the January quarter, but you're guiding to year-over-year acceleration in April and through the year. So if you can just rank order for us the confidence in the acceleration. Is that based on your H100 ramp or generative AI sales coming through or the new AI services model?

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,19,Colette Kress,"Executive Vice President, Chief Financial Officer",company,"-- Sure. Thanks for the question. When we think about our growth, yes, we're going to grow sequentially in Q1 and do expect year-over-year growth in Q1 as well. It will likely accelerate there going forward. So what do we see as the drivers of that? Yes, we have multiple product cycles coming to market. We have H100 in market now. We are continuing with our new launches as well that are sometimes fueled with our GPU computing with our networking. And then we have grades coming likely in the second half of the year. Additionally, generative AI, it's sparked interest definitely among our customers, whether those be CSPs, whether those be enterprises, one of those be start-ups. We expect that to be a part of our revenue growth this year. And then lastly, let's just not forget that given the end of Moore's Law, there's an error here of focusing on AI, focusing on accelerated continuing. So as the economy improves, this is probably very important to the enterprises and it can be fueled by the existence of cloud first for the enterprises as they [Inaudible].

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 22, 2023","December 31, 2022.",1,22,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- First, I'll start backwards. I believe the number of AI infrastructures are going to grow all over the world. And the reason for that is AI, the production of intelligence, is going to be manufacturing. There was a time when people manufacture just physical goods. In the future, there will be -- almost every company will manufacture soft goods. It just happens to be in the form of intelligence. Data comes in. That data center does exactly one thing and one thing only. It cranks on that data and it produces a new updated model. Where raw material comes in, a building or an infrastructure cranks on it, and something refined or improved comes out that is of great value, that's called the factory. And so I expect to see AI factories all over the world. Some of it will be hosted in cloud. Some of it will be on-prem. There will be some that are large, and there are some that will be mega large, and then there'll be some that are smaller. And so I fully expect that to happen, number one. Number two. Over the course of the next 10 years, I hope through new chips, new interconnects, new systems, new operating systems, new distributed computing algorithms and new AI algorithms and working with developers coming up with new models, I believe we're going to accelerate AI by another million x. There's a lot of ways for us to do that. And that's one of the reasons why NVIDIA is not just a chip company because the problem we're trying to solve is just too complex. You have to think across the entire stack all the way from the chip, all the way into the data center across the network through the software. And in the mind of one single company, we can think across that entire stack. And it's really quite a great playground for computer scientists for that reason because we can innovate across that entire stack. So my expectation is that you're going to see really gigantic breakthroughs in AI models in the next company, the AI platforms in the coming decade. But simultaneously, because of the incredible growth and adoption of this, you're going to see these AI factories everywhere. Operator This concludes our Q&A session. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen Huang for closing remarks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2023/02/22/nvidia-nvda-q4-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

The accumulation of breakthroughs from transformers, large language model and generative AI has elevated the capability and versatility of AI to a remarkable level. A new computing platform has emerged. New companies, new applications and new solutions to long-standing challenges are being invented at an astounding rate. Enterprises in just about every industry are activating to apply generative AI to reimagine their products and businesses. The level of activity around AI, which was already high, has accelerated significantly. This is the moment we've been working toward for over a decade. And we are ready. Our Hopper AI supercomputer with the new transformer engine and Quantum InfiniBand fabric is in full production, and CSPs are racing to open their Hopper cloud services. As we work to meet the strong demand for our GPUs, we look forward to accelerating growth through the year. Don't miss the upcoming GTC.

Colette, just wanted to clarify first, I think last quarter, you gave us a sell-through rate for your gaming business at about $2.5 billion a quarter. I think you said China is somewhat weaker. So I was hoping you could update us on what that sell-through rate is right now for gaming. And then, Jen-Hsun, the question for you. A lot of concerns about large hyperscalers cutting their spending and pointing to a slowdown. So if, let's say, U.S. cloud capex is flat or slightly down next year, do you think your business can still grow in the data center and why?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

Thanks for the question. Let me first start with the sell-through on our gaming business. we had indicated, if you put two quarters together, we would see approximately $5 billion in normalized sell-through for our business. Now, during the quarter, sell-through in Q3 three was relatively solid. We've indicated that although China lockdowns continue to channel -- excuse me, challenge our overall China business. It was still relatively solid. Notebook sell-through was also quite solid. And desktop, a bit softer, particularly in that China and Asia areas. We expect though stronger end demand, though, as we enter into Q4, driven by the upcoming holidays, as well as the continuation of the ADA adoption.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,3,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Vivek, our data center business is indexed to two fundamental dynamics. The first has to do with general purpose computing no longer scaling. And so, acceleration is necessary to achieve the necessary level of cost efficiency scale and energy efficiency scale so that we can continue to increase workloads while saving money and saving power. Accelerated computing is recognized generally as the path forward as general purpose computing slows. The second dynamic is AI. And we're seeing surging demand in some very important sectors of AIs in important breakthroughs in AI. One is called deep recommender systems, which is quite essential now to the best content or item or product to recommend to somebody who's using a device that is like a selfie or interacting with a computer just using voice. You need to really understand the nature, the context of the person making the request and make the appropriate recommendation to them. The second has to do with large language models. This is -- this started several years ago with the invention of the transformer, which led to Bert, which led to GP3, which led to a whole bunch of other models now associated with that. We now have the ability to learn representations of languages of all kinds. It could be human language. It could be the language of biology. It could be the language of chemistry. And recently, I just saw a breakthrough called Jeans LM, we just one of the first example of learning the language of human genomes. The third has to do with generative AI. You know that the first 10 years, we've dedicated ourselves to perception AI. But the goal of perception, of course, is to understand context. But the ultimate goal of AI is to make a contribution to create something to generate product. And this is now the beginning of the era of generative AI. You probably see it all over the place, whether they're generating images or generating videos or generating text of all kinds and the ability to augment our performance to enhance our performance to make productivity enhanced to reduce cost and improve whatever we do with whatever we have to work with, productivity is really more important than ever. And so, you could see that our company is indexed to two things, both of which are more important than ever, which is power efficiency, cost efficiency and then, of course, productivity. And these things are more important than ever. And my expectation is that we're seeing all the strong demand and surging demand for AI and for niche reasons.

We're making excellent progress in NVIDIA AI enterprise. In fact, you saw probably that we made several announcements this quarter associated with clouds. You know that NVIDIA has a rich ecosystem. And over the years, our rich ecosystem and our software stack has been integrated into developers and start-ups of all kinds, but more so -- more than ever, we're at the tipping point of clouds, and that's fantastic. Because if we could get NVIDIA's architecture and our full stack into every single cloud, we could reach more customers more quickly. And this quarter, we announced several initiatives, one has several partnerships and collaborations, one that we announced today, which has to do with Microsoft and our partnership there. It has everything to do with scaling up AI because we have so many start-ups clamoring for large installations of our GPU so that they could do large language model training and building their start-ups and scale out of AI to enterprise and all of the world's Internet service providers. Every company we're talking to would like to have the agility and the scale, flexibility of clouds. And so, over the last year or so, we've been working on moving all of our software stacks to the cloud are of our platform and software stacks to the cloud. And so, today, we announced that Microsoft and ourselves are going to standardize on the NVIDIA stack, for a very large part of the work that we're doing together so that we could take a full stack out to the world's enterprise. That's all software included. We, a month ago, announced the same similar type of partnership with Oracle. You also saw that rescale a leader in high-performance computing cloud has integrated NVIDIA AI into their stack. [Inaudible] has been integrated into GCP. And we announced recently Nemo, large language model and bionemo large language model to put NVIDIA software in the cloud. And we also announced Omniverse is now available in the cloud. The goal of all of this is to move the NVIDIA platform full stack off boarding the cloud so that we can engage customers much, much more quickly and customers could engage our software if they would like to use it in the cloud, it's per GPU instance hour if they would like to utilize our software on-prem, they could do it through software license. And so, license and subscription. And so, in both cases, we now have software available practically everywhere you would like to engage it. The partners that we work with are super excited about it because MBDA's rich ecosystem is global, and this could bring both new consumption into their cloud for both them and ourselves, but also connect all of these new opportunities to the other APIs and other services that they offer. And so, our software stack is making really great progress. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Chris Caso with Credit Suisse.

And you also spoke in your prepared remarks that some of this was due to China data centers. So if you can clarify what was in those charges. And then, in general, for your internal inventory. Does that still need to be worked down? And what are the implications if that needs to be worked down over the next couple of quarters?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

So as we highlighted in our prepared remarks, we booked an entry of $702 million for inventory reserves within the quarter. Most of that, primarily, all of it is related to our data center business, just due to the change in expected demand looking forward for China. So when we look at the data center products, a good portion of this was also the A100, which we wrote down. Now, looking at our inventory that we have on hand and the inventory that has increased, a lot of that is just due to our upcoming architectures coming to market. our ADA architecture, our hopper architecture and even more in terms of our networking business. We have been building for those architectures to come to market and as such to say. We are always looking at our inventory levels at the end of each quarter for our expected demand going forward. But I think we've done a solid job that we used in this quarter just based on that expectation going forward. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS.

First, is there any effect of stockpiling in the data center guidance? I ask because you now have the A800 that is sort of a modified version of the A100 with the lower data transfer rate. So one could imagine that customers might be stocking that while they can still get it. And I guess the second part of that is related to the inventory charge, can you just go into that a little bit more? Because last quarter, it made sense that you took a charge because revenue was less than you thought, but revenue came in pretty much in line. And it sounded like China was a net neutral. So is the charge related to just working A100 inventory down faster? Is that what the charges related to?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,9,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Sure. So let me talk about the first statement that you indicated. Most of our data center business that we see is we're working with customers specifically on their needs to build out accelerated computing and AI. It's just not a business in terms of where units are being held for that. They're usually four very, very specific products and projects that we see. So I'm going to answer no. Nothing that we can see. Your second question regarding the inventory provisions. At the end of last quarter, we were beginning to see softness in China. We've always been looking at our needs long term. It's not a statement about the current quarter in inventory, as you can see. It usually takes two or three quarters for us to build product for the future demand. So that's always a case of the inventory that we are ordering. So now looking at what we've seen in terms of continued lockdowns, continued economy challenges in China it was time for us to take a hard look of what do we think we'll need for data center going forward and not leg for write-downs.

Colette, I had a question on the commentary you gave on the sequentials. It kind of sounded like data center maybe had some China softness issues. You said gaming resumed sequential growth. But then you said sequential growth for the company driven by auto gaming and data center. How can all three of those grow sequentially if the overall guidance is kind of flattish? Are they all just like growing just a little bit? Or is one of them actually down? Like how do we think about the segments into Q4 given that commentary?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

So your question is regarding the sequentials from Q3 to our guidance that we provided for Q4. As we are seeing the numbers in terms of our guidance, you're correct, is only growing about $100 million. And we've indicated that three of those platforms will likely grow just a little bit. But our pro visualization business we think is going to be flattish and likely not growing as we're still working on correcting the channel inventory levels. to get to the right amount. It's very difficult to say which will have that increase. But again, we are planning for all three of those different market platforms to grow just a little bit.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,13,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Grace's data moving capability is off the charts. Grace also is memory coherent to our GPU, which allows our GPU to expand its effective GPU memory, fast GPU memory by a factor of 10. That's not possible without special capabilities that are designed between hopper and Grace and the architecture of Grace. And so, it was designed. Grace is designed for very large data processing at very high speeds. Those applications are related to, for example, data processing is related for recommender systems, which operates on petabytes of live data at a time. It's all hot. It all needs to be fast, so that you can make a recommendation within milliseconds to hundreds of millions of people using our service. It is also quite effective at AI training, machine learning. And so, those kind of applications are really terrific. We -- Grace, I think I've said before that we will have production samples in Q1, and we're still on track to do that.

Your data center networking business, I believe, is driving about $800 million per quarter in sales, very, very strong growth over the past few years. Near term, as you guys pointed out, and the team is driving strong Nick and blue food attached to your own compute solutions like DGX and more partner announcements like VMware, but we also know that networking has pretty large exposure to general purpose cloud and hyperscale compute spending trends. So what's the visibility and growth outlook for the networking business over the next few quarters?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,15,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. If I could take that. First, thanks for your question. Our networking, as you know, is heavily indexed to high-performance computing. We're not -- we don't serve the vast majority of commodity networking. All of our network solutions are very high end, and they're designed for data centers that move a lot of data. Now, if you have a hyperscale data center these days, and you are deploying a large number of AI applications. It is very likely that the network bandwidth that you provision has a substantial implication on the overall throughput of your data center. So the small incremental investment they make in high-performance networking translates to billions of dollars of savings slightly in provisioning the service or billions of dollars more throughput, which increases their economics. And so, these days, with disaggregated and I application, AI provisioning and data centers, high-performance networking is really quite fantastic and it pays for itself right away. But that's where we are focused in high-performance networking and provisioning AI services in -- well, the AI applications that we focus on. You might have noticed that NVIDIA and Microsoft are building one of the largest AI infrastructures in the world. And it is completely powered by NVIDIA's InfiniBand 400 gigabits per second network. And the reason for that is because that network pays for itself instantaneously. The investment that you're going to put into the infrastructure is so significant that if you were to be dragged by slow networks, obviously, the efficiency of the overall infrastructure is not as high. And so, in the places where we focus networking is really quite important. It goes all the way back to when we first announced the acquisition of Mellanox. I think at the time, they were doing about a few hundred million dollars a quarter, about $400 million a quarter. And now we're doing what they used to do in the old days, in a year, practically coming up in a quarter. And so, that kind of tells you about the growth of high-performance networking. It is an indexed to overall enterprise and data center spend but it is highly indexed to AI adoption. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.

I want to expand on the networking question a little bit further. When we look at the Microsoft announcement today, we think about what Meda is doing on the AI footprint that they're deploying. Jen-Hsun, can you help us understand like where your InfiniBand networking sits relative to like traditional data center switching? And maybe kind of build on that, how you're positioning spectrum for in the market, does that compete against a broader set of opportunities in the Ethernet world for AI fabric networking?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,17,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks, Erin. The math is like this. If you're going to spend $20 billion on an infrastructure and the efficiency of that overall data center is improved by 10%. The numbers are huge. And when we do these large language models and recommender systems, the processing is done across the entire data center. And so, we distribute the workload across multiple GPUs, multiple nodes and it runs for a very long time. And so, the importance of the network can be overemphasized. And so, the difference of 10% in overall improvement in efficiency, which is very to achieve. The difference between NVIDIA's InfiniBand, the entire software stack with what we call Magnum IO, which allows us to do computing in the network itself. A lot of software is running in the network itself, not just moving data around. We call it in-network computing because a ton of software is done at the edge at the -- within the network itself. We achieved significant differences in overall efficiency. And so, if you're spending billions of dollars on the infrastructure, or even hundreds of millions of dollars of interest on the infrastructure. The difference is really quite profound.

I actually had a couple of clarifications. Colette, in the data center side, is it a fair assumption that compute was down Q-over-Q in the reported quarter because the quarter before, Mellanox or the networking business was up as it was called out. And again, you said it grew quarter over quarter. So is that a fair assumption? And then, I had a clarification on the USG band. Initially, it was supposed to be a $400 million, really going to what the government was trying to firewall. Is the A800 -- I'm just trying to make sure I understand it. Isn't that against the spirit of what the government is trying to do, i.e., firewall, high-performance compute?

And it cannot be customer reprogrammed or application reprogrammed to exceed it. It is hardware limited. It is in the hardware that determines 800s capabilities. And so, it meets the clear test in letter and in spirit. We raised the concern about the $400 million of A100s because we were uncertain about whether we could execute. The introduction of A800 to our customers and through our supply chain in time. The company did remarkable feeds to swarm this situation and make sure that our business was not affected and our customers were not affected.

I'm hoping you can discuss the pace of 100 growth as we progress over the next year. We've gotten a lot of questions as to whether the ramp in this product should look like a sort of traditional product cycle where there's quite a bit of pent-up demand for this significant improved performance product and that there's supply available as well. So does this rollout sort of look relatively typical from that perspective? Or should we expect a more perhaps delayed start of the growth trajectory where we see maybe substantially more growth in, let's say, second half of '23.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,22,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- H-100 ramp is different than the A100 ramp in several ways. The first is that the TCO, the cost benefits, the operational cost benefits because of the energy savings because every data center is now Power Limited. And because of this incredible transformer engine that's designed for the latest AI models. The performance over Ampere is so significant that I -- and because of the pent-up demand for hopper because of these new models that are that I spoke about earlier, deep recommender systems and large language models and generative AI models. Customers are clamoring to ramp hopper as quickly as possible, and we are trying to do the same. We are all hands on deck to help the cloud service providers stand up the supercomputers. Remember, I is the only company in the world that produces and ships semi-custom supercomputers in high volume. It's a miracle to ship one supercomputer every three years. it's unheard of to ship supercomputers to every cloud service provider in a quarter. And so, we're working hand with every one of them, and every one of them are racing to stand up hoppers. We expect them to have hopper cloud services stood up in Q1. And so, we are expecting to ship some volume, we're expecting to ship production in Q4, and then we're expecting to ship large volumes in Q1. That's a faster transition than MPIR. And so, it's because of the dynamics that I described. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

I guess, Colette, I heard in your script that you had talked about maybe a new way of commenting on or reporting hyperscaler revenue in your data center business. And I wonder if you could maybe give us a little bit more detail about what you're thinking there and what sort of drove the decision? And I guess the derivative of that, Jen-Hsun, how -- that decision to talk about the data center business to hyperscalers differently. I mean, what does that mean for the business that is just a reflection of where demand is and you're going to break things out differently?

Let me clarify a little bit in terms of what we believe we should be looking at when we go forward and discussing our data center business. Our data center business is becoming larger and larger and our customers are complex. And when we talk about hyperscale, we tend to talk about seven, eight different companies. But the reality is there's a lot of very large companies that we could add to that discussion based on what they're purchasing. Additionally, looking at the cloud, looking at our cloud purchases and what our customers are building for the cloud is an important area to focus on because this is really where our enterprise is where our researchers, where our higher education is also purchasing. So we're trying to look for a better way to describe the color of what we're seeing in the cloud and also give you a better understanding of some of these large installments that we're seeing in the hyperscales.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/11/16/nvidia-nvda-q3-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,25,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Let me double click on what Colette just said, which is absolutely right. There are two major dynamics that's happening. First, the adoption of NVIDIA in Internet service companies around the world, the number and the scale by which they're doing it has grown a lot. Internet service companies. And these are Internet service companies that offer services, but they're not public cloud computing companies. The second factor has to do with cloud computing. We are now at the tipping point of cloud computing. Almost every enterprise in the world has both a cloud-first and a multi-cloud strategy. It is exactly the reason why all of the announcements that we made this year -- this quarter, this last quarter since GTC about all the new platforms that are now available in the cloud. a CSP, a hyperscaler is both -- are two things to us, therefore, a hyperscaler can be a sell to customer. They are also a cell with partner on the public cloud side of their business. Because of the richness of NVIDIA's ecosystem because we have so many Internet service customers and enterprise customers using NVIDIA's full stack. The public cloud side of their business really enjoys and values the partnership with us and the cell with relationship they have with us. And it's pretty clear now that for all of the hyperscalers, the public cloud side of their business will likely would very likely be the vast majority of their overall consumption. And so, because the world CSPs, the world's public clouds is only at the early innings of their enterprise to lifting enterprise to the cloud world it's very, very clear that the public cloud side of the business is going to be very large. And so, increasingly, our relationship with CSPs, our relationship with hyperscalers will -- will include, of course, continuing to sell to them for internal consumption but very importantly, sell with for the public cloud side.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,27,Jen-Hsun Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- We don't expect to see blockchain being an important part of our business down the road. There is always a resell market. If you look at any of the major resell sites, eBay, for example, there are secondhand graphics cards for sale all the time. And the reason for that is because a 3090 that somebody bought today, is upgraded to a 4090 or 3090 by a couple of years ago, it was up are until 4090 today. That 3090 could be sold to somebody and enjoyed it sold at the right price. And so, the volume of -- the availability of secondhand and used graphics cards has always been there. And the inventory is never zero. and when the inventory is larger than usual, like all supply demand, it would likely drift lower price and affect the lower ends of our market. But my sense is that where we're going right now with ADA is targeting very clearly in the upper range, the top half of our market. And and early signs are, and I'm sure you're also seeing that the ADA launch was a home run. That we shipped a large volume of 4090s because as you know, we were prepared for it. And yet within minutes, they were sold out around the world. And so, the reception of 4090 and the reception of 4080 today has been off the charts. And that says something about the strength and the health and the vibrancy of the gaming market. So we're super enthusiastic about the ADA launch. We have many more ad products to come.

I had two quick ones for Colette. On supply, I think there was some mixed messaging in your remarks. I think you talked about supply being a headwind at one point. And then, when you were speaking to the networking business, I think you talked about supply easing. So I was hoping you can kind of speak to supply if you're caught up to demand at this point. And then, secondly, just on stock-based compensation, pretty mundane topic I realize, but it is -- I think in the quarter, it was about $700 million. It's becoming a bigger piece of your opex.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q3 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Nov 16, 2022","September 30, 2022.",1,29,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Sure. When we look at our supply constraints that we have had in the past, each and every quarter, this is getting better Networking was one of our issues probably a year ago, and it has taken us probably to this quarter. and next quarter to really see our supply improved so that we can support the pipeline that we have for our customers that are -- now that's our supply. We've also made a discussion regarding our customers, supply constraints, issues when setting up a data center, even getting data center capacity has been very difficult. And therefore, that challenges them in their purchasing decisions as they're still looking for certain parts of that supply chain to come through. So that hopefully clarifies what we were talking about regarding two areas of supply. In our stock-based compensation, what we'll see, it's very difficult to predict what our stock-based compensation would be when it arrives. We have provided to our incoming employees but also once a year to our employees, and it's a single date in terms of when that is priced. So it's difficult to determine, but stock-based compensation is an important part of our employees' compensation and will continue to be. So we look at it from an overall compensation perspective. So up until now and when we do the focal, we'll see about the same size with a few additions for the reduced level of employee hiring that we have right now. Operator Thank you.

I think the question we all have is what is normalized revenues for Gaming for you guys. Obviously, this is a challenge for you as well. But curious how you're thinking about it today. Is the fiscal '20 recovery post the first half '19 correction an appropriate framework? Or was that inflated by crypto as well? And I guess, as part of that, how do we think about the cascading in of the new product cycle? And is there potential for future reserves needed to be taken if Gaming does not meet your new updated outlook? Thanks so much.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,2,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Well, let me start first there and see if I can assist in terms of how to think about after we get through our completion just now of Q2 and what we have provided here for guidance for Q3. Across those two quarters, the Q2 of '23, the Q3 of '23, we have likely undershipped Gaming to our end demand significantly. We expect that sell-through or essentially our end demand for those combined two quarters of Q2 and Q3 to be approximately $5 billion. Now on top of this, keep in mind that we do have Gaming growth drivers to consider for the future. These can include our new Gaming product introductions that are around the corner, as well as new segments of the market that we plan to reach with our Gaming technology, to just name a couple. I'll turn it over to Jensen to talk a little bit more about that. Now regarding any further types of write-downs on this perspective, we did a thorough assessment with this quarter, not only just looking at what we needed for this quarter, but what we needed for the long term. Keep in mind, our inventory provisions and write-downs that we took into account had to reflect some of the purchasing that we did a supply back more than a year ago, when we were still in extreme supply shortages in almost all of our products. And so this was an opportunity for us to resize given the macroeconomic conditions, what we needed in terms of supply. So our expectations were higher, and we took this opportunity to write them down to what our current expectations are. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see if he wants to add more.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,3,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Colette. C.J., our sell-through is off the highs in the beginning of the year, but it's still very solid. In fact, sell-through is -- has increased 70% since pre-COVID, pre-pandemic. And so it's very clear that gaming is -- the fundamentals of gaming are strong, and this medium is really doing well. Not to mention, the gaming platforms are being used -- our Gaming PCs are being used for influencers, people sharing content, creating content, vloggers, VTubers, there's all kinds of new ways of engaging and spending time with video games. And our strategy is to reduce the sell-in, reduce the sell-in this quarter or next quarter, to let channel inventory correct. Obviously, we're off the highs, and the macro condition turned sharply worse. And so our first strategy is to reduce sell-in in the next couple of quarters to correct channel inventory. We've also instituted programs to price-position our current products to prepare for next-generation products. Ampere is the most popular GPU we've ever created. It is in the top 15 most popular gaming GPUs on Steam. And it remains the best GPUs in the world, and it will be very successful for some time. However, we do have exciting new next-generation coming and it's going to be layered on top of that. And so we've taken two -- we've done two things. We've reduced sell-in to let channel inventory correct, and we've implemented programs with our partners to price-position the products in the channel in preparation for our next generation. All of this, we anticipate, were working toward a path to being in a good shape going into next year, OK? So that's what our game plan is. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Vivek Arya with Bank of America Securities. Your line is open.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,4,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my question. Actually, I just wanted to clarify, Jensen, so should we assume that a Gaming sell-in will kind of stay at these levels into your Q1 or Q2, or depending on new product launch, it might recover? So I just wanted to make sure our baseline assumption is set there. And then my question is actually similar, on the Data Center. Sales are pretty strong right now, but there is a concern that Data Center capex could be the next shoe to drop in this rolling correction in semiconductors. I'm curious, what's your sense of utilization of your Data Center shipments? And what is the risk that there could be a correction in the Data Center given some of the macro caution expressed by some of the hyperscaler and enterprise customers?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,5,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Vivek. The sell-through, the sell-through as I mentioned earlier, of GeForce is solid. The end-market gaming demand is solid. It's off the highs, which was really high recently in the beginning of the year. And so we have -- and because we were building for such a vibrant market, we found ourselves with excess inventory. And so our strategy is to sell well below -- well -- sell-in well below the current sell-through levels in the marketplace to give the channel an opportunity to correct. We'll do that for a couple of quarters or so. We believe that by the end of the year, we'll be in a good shape going into next year. And so I hope that answers your question, but the important thing is our sell-in rate is far below what is happening in the market for sell-throughs. The sell-through is solid, has increased 70% since pre-COVID. And so the gaming market is really quite vibrant. On the second question, on data center end markets, we hear fairly broadly that GPU supply is in shortage in the cloud. We hear quite broadly that demand for GPU rentals far exceeds current supply. And it's fairly sensible to us, partly because the number of use cases for GPUs in the cloud has grown quite a bit. If you look at one particular segment in just managing -- collecting data and managing the data of the AV fleet and using that data to train AI models, using that data to reconstruct HD maps, the usage of GPUs in the cloud for just that one application has grown a lot. And furthermore, there's -- the deep learning-based recommender systems has demonstrated such significant effectiveness, and it helps Internet service providers to enhance engagement, enhance click-through rate. And so that -- so this particular form of recommender systems is going to really drive a fair amount of data processing and machine learning in the cloud. And then, of course, over the last several years, a very important model has emerged, called Transformers. You and I have spoken about this model several times in the past. And it's been found that this Transformer model, this large language -- this language model, which when scaled up in size, exhibits really spectacular and effective capabilities for -- to be used to learn skills with either few shots or almost no shot, meaning it could learn skills, it could perform skills that it has never learned because the knowledge was somehow encoded from the large amount of data that it had learned from. And so this large language model area of innovation is used and of course, conversational, chat, Q&A, summarization, text generation, image generation. But very importantly, it's being used in life sciences for understanding chemistry. We've done some very important work in this area ourselves, called MegaMolBART, understanding proteins, understanding DNA, to learn the language of these large -- very, very large spatially, as well as temporally or sequentially types of data. And so the impact of this area is really quite worth staying close to. It's called large language models. I think Stanford did a paper that called it foundation models, that could be used for training all kinds of other types of AIs. And so we're seeing a great deal of demand for GPUs in the cloud. We were challenged this quarter with a fair amount of supply chain challenges because as you know, we don't just sell the GPU chip, but these systems are really complex, with a large number of chips in the system components that we offer, like HGX. And so kidding -- all of the components have to come together for us to be able to deliver the final component. And then furthermore, these data centers sit idle until the last piece comes together. And the last piece includes very complicated switches and very complicated NICs and networkings and cables. And so these -- building these high-performance computing data centers at very large scale for the world's clouds is not particularly easy. And so the supply chain challenges have been somewhat disruptive. But the demand is there. And on top of that, we're ramping into Hopper, which is really a fantastic generation. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Matt Ramsay with Cowen. Your line is open.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,6,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good afternoon. I wanted to follow up on the Data Center question that Vivek just asked from a couple of angles. I guess, Colette, the first angle being, in the release, you guys talked about pulling, I don't know, high-$200 millions of revenue into the July quarter from October, but also with supply chain challenges, maybe some deliveries that were meant for July got pushed back into October. So if you could talk a little bit more about those dynamics and just clarify for us that the October sequentially up Data Center guidance is actually clean of any pull-ins. And Jensen, the second part, the moving pieces, networking stronger in Data Center, U.S. hyperscale stronger, China hyperscale weaker. If you could kind of walk us through the trends that you're seeing into the October and January quarters and in those sort of those breakouts and when -- clarify for us when you think H100 will really start to drive revenue. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,7,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Great. Thanks for the question. And it's kind of a little bit of an add-on to some of the statements that Jensen was discussing regarding our supply chain and what we're seeing today. Our supply chain during the quarter really was quite difficult, was quite challenging to work through. Our platforms, including HDX, networking chips, cables, switches, were very important to the customers. It's not just about us selling the GPUs. So even though customers order those components themselves, they're looking from us for what we may refer to as kits, kits that go with those GPUs for them to stand up their data centers. We also experienced supply disruptions internally with our logistics and our component availability. Some of our supply arrived very late in the quarter. We had very little time, from a logistics and availability, to get those things out. Customers were impacted as well by availability of key third-party other components that we weren't offering, which were slowing down some of their deployments. So what we did in our Q2 orders that couldn't be delivered in Q3, given that some of these supply constraints existed, and we had Q3 demand where we did have supply in Q2, so we worked with customers to optimize that supply and demand. And that's what we've disclosed to you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Let me answer the questions about the North American and the China hyperscalers. The Chinese hyperscalers and the Chinese Internet companies really, really slowed down infrastructure investment this year, particularly starting in -- they've been rather slow in building out and really accelerate -- well, really slowed down in Q2. This slowdown can't last forever. And the number of new technologies in software, the number of people who are using clouds and the number of cloud services is continuing to grow. And so I fully expect investment to return. They're a very important market for us, a very large market for us. And the fact that North American hyperscalers doubled year over year, our revenues at North American hyperscalers, and that was offset by declines in China, says something about the slowdown in China. And so I don't think that's going to last forever. I think it's going to return. With respect to Hopper, we're in full production now. And we're racing to get Hopper to all of the CSPs who are dying to get them. And it goes with our HGXs, which is multiple Hoppers on a system tray. It's really a supercomputer in a motherboard, if you will. And it goes along with it networking gear and switch gear. And so there's the enormous amounts of resources applied from all of the CSPs around the world and ourselves to get Hopper to them. We expect to ship substantial Hoppers in Q4. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Toshiya Hari with Goldman Sachs.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,9,Toshi Hari,Goldman Sachs -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks so much for taking the question. I had a question regarding the $1.22 billion inventory charge, maybe for Colette, on this one specifically. In the CFO commentary, I think you state that the inventory charge is related to weaker demand in both Data Center and Gaming. I think the Gaming side is pretty clear based on your comments so far. Curious what's changed on the Data Center side? Is it mostly the Chinese hyperscalers that Jensen just spoke to? Or is there something else going on in terms of how you're thinking about demand in Data Center over the next couple of quarters? And related to this, curious if the delay in Sapphire Rapids at Intel is having an impact on your business in the near to medium term. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,10,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Thanks for the question. So our inventory charges, as we commented, we're taking a thorough look of not only this last quarter, as well as the quarter that we're guiding, but looking over the long term of what we need for demand and then what we had in terms of supply. Remember, we had purchased this very early on in the year as we needed to, to drive the commitment of the supply that we already have. And so what is happening here for the Data Center, we had great, high expectations. We still have very strong, solid growth projection for Data Center as well. But we're going to take this opportunity for some of the prior architecture pieces, to write down those, given what we see as just a change in terms of our expectations going forward. So you are correct. There are also pieces in there for Gaming. We have written down some silicon and chips as the macroeconomic conditions and we get ready for our future product launches, taken into account, but there's also components, services and capacity and some of the other drivers that are incorporated in those write-downs.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,11,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- OK. Our Hopper supports previous-generation CPUs. But I guess, next-generation GPUs -- CPUs, Sapphire Rapids and Genoa after that, as well as Graviton. And so we certify and test across all of the CPUs because the cloud service providers demand it. And they intend to deploy NVIDIA accelerators, NVIDIA Hoppers, across a large number of CPUs. There is no question that the delay is disruptive and a lot of engineers have to scramble. It would have been a lot easier if next-generation CPUs were to have executed more perfectly. However, Hopper goes into an environment with CSPs where they connect our PCI Express connectors to old-generation, current-generation CPUs as well. And so nobody likes the delay. The next-generation CPUs will trigger a refresh of infrastructure and new servers. And so I'm super excited about them. However, we're going to be able to go to market plenty fine with Hopper supporting existing infrastructure. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,12,Aaron Rakers,Wells Fargo Securities -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yeah. Thanks for taking the question, and a lot of it's kind of been talked a little bit about, but I just -- Colette, I want to think about the numbers a little bit more. I guess based on the guidance commentary, where I've come up thinking about would be as like a 30-plus percent sequential decline in Gaming and Professional Visualization and maybe kind of low- to mid-single-digit growth in Data Center and Auto. So I guess, is that the right context? And with that, and with Hopper coming down the pipeline, we're going to have a lot of questions around kind of the deceleration of year-over-year growth in Data Center, I believe. Do you think that Hopper, as that comes fully available, it sounds like in fiscal 4Q, that you actually see Data Center growth reaccelerate as that product cycle materializes?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,13,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks for the question. And that's a pretty good understanding of our guidance. And we do expect, yes, Gaming to decrease, not in the dollar amount that it decreased between Q1 and Q2. So that may be, of our two areas of the decline, our Gaming and ProViz, that may be about three-quarters of it associated with that Gaming, and then Professional Visualization would probably be about one quarter of the two areas that will decline. Our Data Center, yes, we do expect it to grow. It may grow about what we just saw between Q1 and Q2. We'll continue to look at it. There may be some more opportunity there. And Automotive, very similar to our thoughts at the very beginning of the quarter. We are expecting continued growth through each of the quarters of this fiscal year. We felt that Q2 was an inflection point, so we'll continue to grow into Q3 and hopefully Q4 going forward. I'll turn it over to Jensen to see his thoughts in terms of Hopper, what Hopper brings to us in Q4, and the expectations.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,14,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- The first thing I would say, Aaron, is that we are selling in or we're selling far below the market demand, far -- excuse me, far below the market sell-through. And the reason for that is to allow the inventory, the channel inventory and the OEM inventories to correct. And this allows us to prepare for our next generation. And our next generation has Hopper for compute, but we also have the next generation for computer graphics that will be coming to market. Hopper is a giant new generation because it is designed to perform this new type of AI model called Transformers. It has an engine inside it called Transformer engine, with numerical formats and pipelines that allows us to do a spectacular job on Transformer-type of models, which includes large language models, but it also includes computer vision models that are now able to be processed with this new type of AI model called Transformers. And so I fully expect Hopper to be the next springboard for future growth. And the importance of this new model, Transformers, can't possibly be understated and can't be overstated. This is the impact of this model across robotics, computer vision, languages, biology, chemistry, drug design, is just really quite spectacular. And I'm sure that you've been hearing about this new breakthrough in AI, and Hopper was designed for this. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Atif Malik with Citi.

Colette, can you talk about networking versus compute? Were they both supply constrained in the July quarter? And are they both sequentially growing in the October quarter?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,16,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- So within our Q2 results, we have been continuing to improve our supply for networking. We have a lot of important products that the CSP needs, many of our customers need, and we have been working to really improve that supply. And we were able to set very strong growth in terms of networking, both sequentially and year over year. And as we move into the next quarter, we're going to have to see which is going to be growth larger. We're just going to have to take a look once we finish that quarter. But our supply for compute is here. But as we have discussed, sometimes, it's important that they have many of our other components that we provide in networking at the same time that we are providing the GPUs. So sometimes, those are very important for us to deliver together. So we always have to keep that in mind. So it's not always supply constrained, but there are certain parts of it that are.

I wanted to ask, why did the supply constraints hit you guys so hard this quarter. I mean you've done such a great job in the last couple of years, outgrowing really everybody in a very challenging supply chain environment. It hasn't tripped you up at all. And it seems like now it's kind of hitting you fairly hard at a time when, in other cases, it's kind of easing. So I'm just kind of curious, what is it about the timing and how long does it sort of take for -- is that a Hopper issue? Is it related to other components? As you talked about, how long does it take to clear those issues up? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,18,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Let me start and see if Jensen wants to add on to it. Our execution has absolutely been phenomenal, when we think about the challenges of we're almost putting together a full data center for our customers and getting it shipped out. So we're no different. In the same way that the CSPs are challenging, we're setting up their data centers as we're such an integral part of that. And so networking has been short of supply. These are the same supply issues that some of our CSPs are having. So our supply arrived a little bit late in the quarter for some of our key products that we needed to get out. And putting that together caused some disruption in our logistics and distribution. We were pleased in terms of reaching the levels of networking that we did, but we did have some challenges this quarter.

I wanted to go back to that Data Center inventory charge. You listed Data Center first when you talked -- primarily related to Data Center and Gaming. Can you give us a feeling for how much of that charge was Data Center versus Gaming? And then the follow-up on that, it did sound like, to me, that it was mostly Ampere and not Hopper change in expectations. Can you verify that or clarify it? And just talk about what's happened with your expectations for Hopper? Have they gone up or down? Or has there been any change at all relevant to that inventory charge?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,20,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yeah, Stacy. Regarding our inventory charges that we had, when you think about what we have in supply, whether it be chips, components, whether it be memory, remember, a lot of these things can be used interchangeably across the two. Additionally, the value of our inventory for Data Center is much different than the value of what we have for Gaming from an overall cost perspective. So we're creating capacity opportunities, putting together all of those systems in terms of Data Center. It is prior architectures. Absolutely, this is not a question regarding anything of our future products coming to market. Nothing on the inventory provision has to do with that. So we took this as looking at the macroeconomic conditions, as we've discussed. Our expectations, our plans, were higher. They're still quite solid, that we see in demand both for Gaming, as well as solid for Data Center. And that will continue. But we did have to just take a rightsizing of that inventory.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,21,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Hopper was designed for Transformers. The new Transformers was going to be important. Nobody could have predicted the profound importance of large language models. Large language models, excitement, innovation, ideas, companies, start-ups, industries, all exceeding everyone's expectations. I don't think anybody could have predicted the impact of Transformers as it scaled up to these giant sizes. There's a fair amount of literature now written about language models that were smallish in the old days, in the beginning, several years ago, three years ago. And the ones that are in the hundreds of billions and moving toward probably several trillion parameters, the effectiveness of the AI is really quite spectacular. And to have AI that was never trained on a particular skill and yet within one shot or one shot of trying or even no shots, are able to perform that skill, is beyond anybody's expectations, I would think. And so I think the -- if the success of Hopper is -- reflects the amount of work and pent-up demand for large training systems that Hopper is going to go into, that's an indicator, I think, Hopper is going to be a spectacular success.

I have a question on gross margins, Colette. The 65% non-GAAP number you're guiding to, does that include or assume any additional write-offs on the inventory front? And then just to expand on that, your mix is probably a tailwind to gross margins given that Gaming is down significantly and that Data Center is up a little bit. And I'm just wondering, are there any other offsets because I would have thought gross margins could actually be better than your longer-term model because of the mix tailwinds. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

Thanks for the question. So our gross margins outside of the inventory charges in Q2, as well as going into Q3 is really about our sales mix that we have and probably also to understand that our sales mix in the next quarter for GPUs is not in the high end. And so that has impacted our gross margin as we move into Q3. You are correct. We do expect that Data Center will assist in our gross margins, but we also have growth plans in Auto. Auto is below our company average, and so that will tend to offset some of those upper-bound things that we will see in terms of Data Center. From time to time, there's always a small amount of scraps that we will have in our gross margin estimates. So nothing material is planned, but there is small scraps that may occur from quarter to quarter that are included in our gross margins.

So my clarification is whether October gross margins are benefiting at all from the sale of previously written down inventory. And then my question is whether you can give us the enterprise cloud split in Data Center because it sounds like the mix shifted more toward enterprise in July. And I think investors might want to see that as risky in the face of enterprise clearly slowing. So I'm wondering if you can give us that.

No. No, there is nothing in our Q3 regarding those inventory provisions that we took in terms of earning that back, in terms of our Q3. Regarding our split between our hyperscalers and data centers and what we refer to as our vertical industries, they always tend to be about the same, 50% for one, 50% for the others. They're still in about that range. We had discussed that our China hyperscalers did not drive growth in terms of sequentially here. And so that did influence in terms of the hyperscalers, but still we are approximately in that 50%, 50%. Operator Your next question will come from the line of Harlan Sur with J.P. Morgan.

On the weakness in ProViz, this is an enterprise-focused business, right? Granted, it's a somewhat narrow vertical market, but it does sort of play into the market concerns that consumer is weak now, enterprise is the next shoe to drop. So is the decline in ProViz attributed to enterprise spending weakness? Or is there some other dynamic? And why or why not is this not a leading indicator for your enterprise and vertical industry segments within your Data Center business?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,27,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- So our Pro Visualization business, just in such a short time, they were in short supply and really trying to feed so much of the industry's desire to both refresh and attracted to the new RTX workstations that were there. We were fueling both mobile, as well as desktop for that market and growing quite nicely. Remember, all of last year doubled the size of ProViz in one year. So right now, the OEMs are concentrating on their levels of inventory. We want to make sure that they can get through that inventory. But it -- keep in mind, very similar to our discussion on Gaming, there is still solid demand. There is still solid demand. We just have to correct some of the inventory, but we still see both the opportunities that we've created for the market for these to be long-standing. OK? And your second question, remind me again.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,28,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Whether the broader enterprise market is going to be -- the verticals are going to be affected by that. I would say, first of all, we don't know. Second of all, unlike our Workstation business, our ProViz business, there's no installed base. Most of the ProViz sales tend to be upgrades or replacements from something that has our installed base of three or four or five years, that people -- whatever upgrade cycle they happen to have. And so in the case of ProViz, the companies that are buying ProViz, our ProViz systems, likely already have systems that they've been using. And so if they were to tighten up ProViz, for whatever reason, the people could continue to use what they have. In the case of our AI business, there's no real installed base. These are all brand-new things that people are growing into. And the productivity benefits or the cost savings benefits of using autonomous systems is fairly profound. And it's not so much that the demand isn't out there. Everybody would like to be more productive. Everybody would like to save more money. Everybody would like to move faster. It's just that AI's understanding and AI's use is still spreading. And so we're delighted by the rate of growth and the rate of adoption of enterprise. My sense is that our AI business and our Viz business have very different characteristics for that reason. But what Colette said earlier is, about our ProViz businesses last quarter, is absolutely true, which is OEMs realizing that the end market is slowing and taking the opportunity to correct their inventory.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,29,Ross Seymore,Deutsche Bank -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hey, guys. Thanks for letting me ask a question. I just had a longer-term question about once your Gaming business normalizes, with the absence of crypto in a general sense and with the merge coming, etc., how do you view the pricing environment? I know you guys really weren't raising prices like we saw in the MSRP premiums in the aftermarket. But generally, your mix was quite rich over the last year or two. You're going to have Lovelace coming in that will obviously help the mix sequentially versus the last couple of quarters. But how do you think about it normalizing? If that $2.5 billion per quarter sell-through rate comes, is the ASP mix across your stack about the same, or does it go down because of the absence of that crypto-tightening dynamic?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,30,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- I would say that without crypto dynamic, the mix would go down. However, the overall trend long-term, the ASP is drifting up. And the way to think about that is a game console, when -- my first game console was $99. Lately, game consoles are selling for about $599. And the reason for that is because it's more useful than ever. You use your game console for your greatest form of entertainment, and you use it for a very, very long time. And GeForce essentially is a game console inside your PC. And we've always believed that the ASP of GeForce should drift toward the average selling price of a game console. And so it should be something along the lines of $500 or so roughly at this time. We also have GeForce in the cloud. And because GeForce in the cloud is hosting many gamers simultaneously, it tends to want to be a much more powerful GeForce. And so our cloud-gaming GeForce tends to be -- our cloud-gaming graphics tends to be a much higher-end. And so -- and then, of course, there's the design aspect of it. Most designers and most creators are able to use GeForce these days. And they use their PC to create content. And much of that content goes into video games and/or they're using video games to create their artistic content. And so the GeForce is not just for gaming for them, the GeForce is essentially their creative workstation as well. And so there are several dynamics that are causing the ASP of GeForce to go up, and we've been seeing this trend for several years now. Operator Thank you. I will now turn the call back over to Jensen for closing remarks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/08/24/nvidia-nvda-q2-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q2 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 24, 2022","June 30, 2022.",1,31,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, everyone. We're navigating our supply chain transitions in a challenging macro environment. In Gaming, our partners and ecosystem are responding to a sudden slowdown in consumer demand and correcting channel inventory. Still, the fundamentals of gaming are strong. We'll get through this over the next few months and go into next year with our new architecture. I look forward to telling you more about it at GTC next month. In Data Center, AI, where computers are helping us write software that was impossible before, is driving a computing revolution and transforming every industry. NVIDIA's leadership in full-stack data center scale accelerated computing has made us the ideal partner for companies racing to leverage the power of AI. Even with the current macroeconomic headwinds, demand for our Data Center products have never been stronger. The next wave of computing is coming. With AI and 3D graphics advances, developers will extend the Internet with virtual world overlays that connect to the physical world. This next evolution of the Internet is called metaverse. We created Omniverse to connect the digital and physical world and be an open platform for creating and operating metaverse applications. The immediate applications for Omniverse span product design, manufacturing and operations. Omniverse is off to a great start. Our Automotive revenue is inflecting, and we expect it to be our next billion-dollar business. Autonomous driving is one of the biggest challenges AI can solve, and computing opportunity for us spans the data center to the car. Autonomous driving will transform the auto industry into a tech industry. Automotive is one of the first to transform into a software-defined tech industry. But all industries will be. We're building NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse to be the engines for the world's enterprise to become software-defined, AI-powered technology companies. I look forward to next month's GTC conference, where we will share new advances of RTX reinventing 3D graphics in gaming, AI's continuing breakthroughs and building the metaverse, the next evolution of the Internet.

I guess would love to get an update on how you're thinking about the Gaming cycle from here. The business has essentially doubled over the last two years. And now we've got some crosswinds with crypto falling off, channel potentially clearing ahead of a new product cycle. You talked about macro challenges. But at the same time, only a third of the installed base has RTX and we're moving out from under supply. So we'd love to hear your thoughts from here once we get beyond kind of the challenges around COVID lockdown in the July quarter? How are you thinking about Gaming trends?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,2,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, C.J. Thanks for the question. You captured a lot of the dynamics well in your question. The underlying dynamics of the Gaming industry is really solid, net of the situation with COVID lockdown in China and Russia. The rest of the market is fairly robust and we expect the Gaming dynamics to be intact. The several things that are driving the Gaming the last two years alone, 100 million new gamers came into the PC industry. The format has expanded tremendously. And the ways that people are using their PCs to connect with friends, to be an influencer as a platform for themselves, use it for broadcast. So, many people are now using their home PCs as their second workstation, if you will, second studio. Because they're also working from home. It is our primary way of communicating these days. The need for GeForce PCs have never been greater. And so I think the fundamental dynamics are really good. And so as we look into the second half of the year, we look -- it's hard to predict exactly what -- when COVID and the war in Russia is going to be behind us. But nonetheless, the governing dynamics of the Gaming industry is great. Operator Next, we'll go to Matt Ramsay with Cowen.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,3,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. Good morning. Jensen, I wanted to ask a bit of a question on the Data Center business. In this upcoming cycle with H-100, there's some I/O upgrades that are happening in servers that I think are going to be a fairly strong driver for you in addition to what's going on with Hopper and the huge performance leaps that are there. I wanted to ask a longer-term question, though, around your move to NVLink with Grace and Hopper and what's going on with your whole portfolio. Do you envision the business continuing to be sort of card-driven attached to third-party servers, or do you think revenue shifts dramatically, or in a small way, over time, to be more sort of vertically integrated all of the chips together on NVLink? And how is the industry sort of responding to that potential move? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,4,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. I appreciate the question. The -- let's see, the first point that you made is a very big point. The next generation of servers that are being teed up right now are all Gen 5. The I/O performance is substantially higher than what was available before. And so you're going to see a pretty large refresh as a result of that. Brand-new networking cards from our company and others. Gen 5, of course, drives new platform refresh. And so, we're perfectly timed to ramp into the Gen 5 generation with Hopper. There are a lot of different system configurations you want to make. If you take a step back and look at the type of systems that are necessary for data processing, scientific computing, machine learning and training, inference done in the cloud for hyperscale nature, done on-prem for enterprise computing, done at the edge. Each one of these workloads and deployment locations, the way that you manage would dictate a different system architecture. So there isn't one size that fits all, which is one of the reasons why it's so terrific that we support PCI Express that we innovated chip-to-chip interconnect for diverse -- before anybody else did, this is now some seven years ago, we're in our fourth generation of NVLink that allows us to connect two chips next to each other, two dies, two chips, two modules, two SXM modules to two systems to multiple systems. And so our coherent chip-to-chip link, NVLink has made it possible for us to mix and match chips, dies, packages, systems and all of these different types of configurations. And I think that, over time, you're going to see even more types of configurations. And the reason for that has to do with a couple of very important new type of data centers that are emerging. And you're starting to see that now with fairly large installations, infrastructures with NVIDIA, HPC and NVIDIA AI. These are really AI factories where you're processing the data, refining the data and turning that data into intelligence. These AI factories are essentially running one major workload and they're running at 24/7. Deep recommender systems is a good example of that. In the future, you're going to see large language models essentially becoming a platform themselves. That would be running 24/7, hosting a whole bunch of applications. And then on the other end, you're seeing data centers at the edge that are going to be robotics or autonomous data centers that are running 24/7. They are going to be running in factories and retail stores and warehouses, logistics warehouses, all over the world. So these two new types of data centers are just emerging, and they also have different architectures. So I think the net of it all is that our ability to support every single workload because we have a universal accelerator, running every single workload from data processing to data analytics to high-performance computing to training to inference that we can support Arm and x86 that we support PCI Express to Multisystem NVlink to multi-chip NVLink to multi-die NVLink, that capability for us is -- makes it possible for us to really be able to serve all of these different segments. With respect to vertical integration, I think that system integration, the better way to make me saying that is that system integration is going to come in all kinds of different ways. We're going to do semi-custom chips as we've done with many companies in the past, including Nintendo. We'll do semi-custom chiplets as we do with NVLink. NVLink is open to our partners. And they could bring it to any fab and connect it coherently into our chip. We could do multi module packages. We could do multi-package systems. So there's a lot of different ways to do system integration. Operator Next, we'll go to Stacy Rasgon with Bernstein Research.

I wanted to follow up on the sequential. So Colette, I know you said the $500 million was a $400 million hit to Gaming and a $100 million hit to data. So I'm assuming that -- that doesn't mean the Gaming is down $400 million. I mean it's Gaming -- do you see Gaming actually down more than the actual Russia and lockdown hit. And I guess just how do I think about the relative sequentials of the businesses in light of those constraints that you guys are facing?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,6,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Sure. Let me start first with what does that mean to Gaming. What does that mean to Gaming for Q2? We do expect Gaming to decline into Q2. We still believe our end demand remains very strong. Ampere has just been a great architecture, and there's many areas where we continue to see strength and growth in both our sell-through and probably what we will see added into that channel as well. But in total, Q2 Gaming will decline from last quarter from Q1 that it will probably decline in the teens. As we try and work through some of these lockdowns in China, which are holding us up. So overall, the demand for Gaming is still strong. We still expect end demand to grow year over year in Q2. Operator Next, we'll go to Mark Lipacis with Jefferies.

If you listen to the networking OEMs, this earnings season, it seems that there was a lot of talk about increased spending by enterprises on their data centers and sometimes you hear them talking about how this is being driven by AI. You talked about your year-over-year growth in your cloud versus enterprise spending. I wonder if you could talk about what you were seeing sequentially? Are you seeing a sequential inflection in the enterprise? And can you talk about the attach rate of software for enterprise versus data centers. And, which software is -- are you seeing the most interest? I know you talked about, is it Omniverse? Is it natural language processing, or is there one big driver, or is it a bunch of drivers for the various different software packages you have? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks, Mark. We had a record Data Center business this last quarter. We expect to have a record, another record quarter this quarter, and we're fairly enthusiastic about the second half. AI and data-driven machine learning techniques for writing software and extracting insight from the vast amount of data that companies have is incredibly strategic to all the companies that we know. Because in the final analysis, AI is about automation of intelligence and most companies are about domain-specific intelligence. We want to produce intelligence. And there are several techniques now that have been created to make it possible for most companies to apply their data to extract insight and to automate a lot of the predictive things that they have to do and do it quickly. And so I think the trend that you hear other people are experiencing about machine learning, data analytics, data driven insights, artificial intelligence. However, it's described, it's all exactly the same thing. And it's sweeping just about every industry and every company. Our networking business is also highly supply constrained. Our demand is really, really high. And it requires a lot of components aside from just our chips. Components and transceivers and connectors and cables. And just -- it's a really -- it's a complicated system, the network, and there are many physical components. And so the supply chain has been problematic. We're doing our best and our supply has been increasing from Q4 to Q1. We're expecting it to increase in Q2 and increase in Q3 and Q4. And so we're really, really grateful for the support from the component industry around us, and we'll be able to increase that. With respect to software, there are two, well, first of all, there are all kinds of machine learning models, computer vision, speech AI, natural language understanding, all kinds of robotics applications, the most -- probably the largest, the most visible one is self-driving cars, which is essentially a robotic AI. And then recently, this incredible breakthrough from an AI model called Transformers that has led to really, really significant advances in natural language understanding. And so they're all these different types of models. There are thousands and thousands of species of AI models and used in all these different industries. One of my favorite, I'll just say it very quickly and I'll answer that question about the software. One of my favorites is using Transformers to understand the language of chemistry or using transformers and using AI models to understand the language of proteins, amino acids, which is genomics. To apply AI to understand -- to recognize the patterns, to understand the sequence and essentially understand the language of chemistry and biology is a really, really important breakthrough. And all of this excitement around synthetic biology, much of it stands back to some of these inventions. But anyhow, all of these different models need an engine to run on. And that engine is called NVIDIA AI. In the case of hyperscalers, they can cobble together a lot of open source and we provide a lot of our source to them and a lot of our engines to them for them to operate their AI. But for enterprises, they need someone to package it together and be able to support it and refresh it, update it for new architecture, support old architectures in their installed base, etcetera, and all the different use cases that they have. And so that engine is called NVIDIA AI. It's almost like a sequel engine, if you will. And except this is an engine for artificial intelligence. There's another engine that we provide and that engine is called Omniverse and it's designed for the next wave of AI, where artificial intelligence has to not just manipulate information like recommender systems and conversational systems and such. But it has to interact with physical systems. Whether it's interacting with physics directly, meaning robotics or being able to automate physical systems like heat recovery steam generators, which is really important today. And so Omniverse is designed to be able to sit at that interface, that intersection between simulation and artificial intelligence, and that's what Omniverse is about. Omniverse has now – let's see some -- we're still early in the deployment of Omniverse for commercial license. It's been a couple of quarters now since we've released Omniverse enterprise. And I think, at this point, we have 10% of the world's top 100 companies that are already customers, licensing customers, substantially more who we're evaluating. I think it's been downloaded nearly 200,000 times. It has been tried in some 700 companies. And Colette highlighted some of the companies, you might see some of the companies that are using it in all kinds of interesting applications at GTC. And so, I fully expect that the NVIDIA AI engine, the Omniverse engine, are going to be very successful for us in the future and contribute greatly to our earnings.

Just wanted to clarify, Colette, if your Q2 outlook includes any destocking benefits from the new products that you're planning to launch this year. And then my question is gentleman for you. You're still guiding Data Center to a very strong, I think, close to 70% or so year-on-year growth, despite all the headwinds. Are you worried at all about all the headlines about the slowdown in the macro economy? I like is there any cyclical impact on Data Center growth that we should keep in mind as we think about the second half of the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

Vivek, let me first answer the question that you asked regarding any new products as we look at Q2. As we discussed about it, most of the ramp that we have of our new architectures, we're going to see in the back half of the year. We're going to start to see, for example, Hopper will probably be here in Q3, but starting to ramp closer to the end of the calendar year. So, you should think about most of our product launches to be ramping in the second half of the year on that part. I'll turn it over for Jensen Huang for the rest.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,11,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks. Our Data Center demand is strong and remains strong. Hyperscale and cloud computing revenues, as you mentioned, has grown significantly. It's doubled year over year. and we're seeing really strong adoption of A100. A100 is really quite special and unique in the world of accelerators. And this is one of the really, really great innovations as we extended our GPU from graphics to CUDA to Tensor Core GPUs. It's now a universal accelerator. And so you could use it for data processing for ETL, for example, extract, transform, and load. You could use it for database acceleration. Many sequel functions are accelerated on NVIDIA GPUs. We accelerate Rapids, we accelerate which is the Python version a Data Center scale version of Pandas, we accelerate Spark 3.0. And so from database queries to data processing, to extraction, and transform and loading of data before you do training and inference and whatever image processing or other algorithmic processing you need to do can be fully accelerated on A100. And so we're seeing great success there. On at the core and closer to what is happening today, you're seeing several different very important new AI models that are being invested in at very, very large scale and with great urgency. You probably have heard about Deep Recommender Systems. This is the economic engine, the information filtering engine of the Internet, if not for the recommender system, it would be practically impossible for us to enjoy our Internet experience shopping experience with trillions of things that are changing in the world every day constantly and be able to use your three-inch phone to even engage the Internet. And so all of that magic is made possible by this incredible thing call a recommender system second thing is conversational AI. You're seeing chat bots and website customer service, even live customer service being now supported by AI, conversational AI has an opportunity to enhance the customer service on the one hand. On the other hand, supplement for a lot of labor shortage. And then the third is this groundbreaking piece of work as related to Transformers that led to natural language understanding breakthrough. But within it, is this incredible thing called large language models, which embeds human knowledge because it's been trained and so much data. And we recently announced Megatron 530B. And it was a collaboration we did with Microsoft, the foundation of – I think they call it Turing. And this language model and others like it, like open AI, GPD 3 are really transformative and they take an enormous amount of computation. However, the net result is a pre-trade model that is really quite remarkable. Now we're working with thousands of start-ups, large companies that are building who are using the public cloud. And so it's driving a lot of demand for us in the public cloud. I think we have now 10,000 AI inception start-ups that are working with us and using NVIDIA AI, whether it's on-prem or in the cloud, it saves money, because the computation time is significantly reduced. The quality of service is a lot better and they could do greater things. And so that's driving AI in the cloud. And so all of these different factors, whether it's just the industrial recognition of the importance of AI, the transformative nature of these new AI models recommender systems, large language models, conversational AI. The thousands of companies around the world that are using NVIDIA AI in the cloud -- driving public cloud demand, all of these things are driving our Data Center growth. And so we expect to see Data Center demand remain strong. Operator Next, we'll go to Tim Arcuri with UBS.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,12,Tim Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thank you very much. I had a question about this $500 million impact for July and whether it's more supply related or demand related. And that's because most others in semis are sort of setting this China stuff, in particular, is more of a logistics issues, so more of a supply issues, but the language Colette you were using in your commentary side of lower sell-through in gaming and sort the absence of sales in Russia, to me that sounds a little more demand which would make sense in the context of this new freeze on hiring that you have. So I ask because if it's supply related, then you could argue that it's not perishable and really just timing. But if demand related that might never come back and it to be the beginning of a falling night. So, I wonder if you can sort of walk through that for me? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,13,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Thanks, Tim, for the question. Let me try and bet here on the China and Russia, two very different things. The current China lockdowns that we are seeing interestingly has implications to both supply and demand. We have seen challenges in terms of the logistics throughout the country, things going in out of the country. It puts a lot of pressure on just logistics that were already under pressure. From a demand perspective, it has also been head from the gaming side. You have very large cities that are in full lockdown, focusing really on other important things for the citizens there. So, it's impacting our demand. We do believe that they will come out of COVID and the demand for our products will come back. We do believe that will occur. The supply will sort it out. It's very difficult to determine how. Now, in the case of Russia, we're not selling to Russia. That's something that we had announced earlier last quarter. But there were plans and Russia has been a part of our overall company revenue of probably about 2% of our company revenue historically and a little larger percentage when you look at our Gaming business. I hope that helped. Operator Next, we'll go to Ambrish Srivastava with BMO.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,14,Ambrish Srivastava,BMO Capital Markets -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Thank you very much, Colette and Jensen. I actually really appreciate it that you called out demand from those two companies, it feels like it's healthy to say demand is a problem, so refreshing to hear that. I had a question on the second half and it relates to both Data Center as well as Gaming. So, last couple of times you have talked publicly, you have made comments that your visibility into the Data Center has never been better. So, I was wondering if you just take out the Russia impact, is that still true, all the orders that you have been getting there intact and you did say that business will see a strong momentum. I just want to make sure that statement of confidence you have made stays? And then on Gaming, Colette, do we expect second half to be up year over year just based on the guide for second quarter? It seems like it could be up sequentially but may not return to year-over-year growth in Q3. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,15,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Ambrish, thanks for the question. On first principles, it should be the case that our visibility of Data Centers is vastly better, vastly better than a couple of years ago. And the reason for that is several. One, if you recall a couple two, three years ago, deep learning and AI was starting to accelerate in the most computer science deep companies in the world with CSPs and hyperscalers. And -- but just about everywhere else, it was still quite nascent. And there was a couple of reasons for that. Obviously, the understanding of the technology is not as pervasive at the time. The type of industrial use cases for artificial intelligence requires labeling of data that's really quite difficult. And then now with Transformers, you have unsupervised learning and other techniques, zero-shot learning that allows us to do all kinds of interesting things without having to have human-labeled data. We even have synthetic generated data with Omniverse that helps customers do data generation without having to label data, which is either too costly, or quite frankly, oftentimes impossible. And so now, the knowledge and the technology has evolved to a place that most of the industries could use artificial intelligence at a fairly effective way and in many industries rather transformative. And so I think, number one, we went from clouds and hyperscalers to all of industries. Second, we went from training-focused to inference. Most people thought that inference was going to be easy. It turns out the inference is by far the harder. And the reason for that is because there are so many different models and there are so many different use cases and so many quality of service requirements, and you want to run these inference models in a small of a footprint as you can. And so when you scale out, the number of users that use the service is really quite high. So using acceleration, using NVIDIA's platform, we could inference any model from computer vision to speech to chemistry to biology, you name it. And we do it so quickly and so fast that the cost is very low. And so the more acceleration you do, the more money you will save. And that, I think, that wisdom is absolutely true. And so the second dimension is training to inference. The third dimension is that we now have so many different types of configurations of systems that we can go from high-performance computing systems all the way to cloud to on-prem to edge. And then the final concept is really this industrial deployment now of AI that's causing us to be able to in just about every industry, find growth. And so as you know, our cloud and hyperscalers are growing very, very quickly. However, the vertical part, vertical industries, which is financial services and retail and telco and all of those vertical industries have also grown very, very nicely. And so, in all of those different dimensions, our visibility should be a lot better. And then starting a couple of years ago, adding the Mellanox portfolio to our company, we're able to provide a lot more solution-oriented end-to-end platform solutions for companies that don't have the skills and don't have the technical depth to be able to stand up these sophisticated systems. And so, our networking business is growing very, very nicely as well. Operator Next, we'll go to Harlan Sur with J. P. Morgan.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,16,Harlan Sur,J.P. Morgan -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Hi. Good afternoon. Thanks for letting me ask the question. I just want to maybe just ask this question a little bit more directly. So, it's good to see the team being able to drive – navigate the dynamic supply chain environment, right? You look strong sequential growth in data center in April, here in the July quarter, even with some demand impact from Russia, right? And so, as we think about the second half of the year, cloud spending is strong, and it's actually, I think, accelerating. You're getting ready to ramp H100 later in the year. Mellanox, I think, is getting more supply as you move through the year. And in general, I think previously, you guys were anticipating sequential supply and revenue growth for the business through this entire year. I understand the uncertainty around gaming, but does the team expect continued sequential growth in data center through the remainder of the year?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Either one of those answers -- the answer is yes. We see a strong demand in data center, hyperscale to cloud computing to vertical industries. Ampere is going to continue to scale out. It's been qualified in every single company in the world. And so, after two years, it remains the best universal accelerator on the planet, and it's going to continue to scale out in all these different domains and different markets. We're going to layer on top of that, a brand-new architecture Hopper. We're going to layer on top of that brand-new networking architectures. Quantum 3, CX-7, BlueField 3. And we have increasing supply. And so we're looking forward to an excellent quarter next quarter again for data centers and going into the second half.

Wonder if you could speak a little bit about the purchase obligations, which seemed like they were up again in the quarter. And how that – was that a function of longer-dated obligations or a higher magnitude of obligations? And maybe you could just speak to supply constraints in general. You've mentioned a couple of times in the call, about continued constraints in the networking business. What about the other parts of the business? Where are you still constrained?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

So let me start here, and I'll see if Jensen wants to add more of that. Our purchase obligations, as well as our prepaid have two major things to keep in mind. One, for the first time ever, we are prepaying to make sure that we have that supply and those commitments long term. And additionally, on our purchase obligations, many of them are for long lead time items that are a must for us to procure to make sure that we have the products coming to market. A good percentage of our purchase commitments is for our Data Center business, which you can imagine, are much larger systems, much more complex systems and those things that we are procuring to make sure we can feed the demand both in the upcoming quarters and further. Areas in terms of where we are still a little bit supply constrained are networking. Our demand is quite strong. We've been improving it each time. But yes, we still have demand -- excuse me, supply concerns with networking still. Is there others that you want to add on, Jensen?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/

And most of my questions around Gaming and Data Center have been answered. But I guess I'll ask about the Auto segment. While it's still small, clearly, you guys sound confident in that business starting to see ""significant sequential growth"" into this next quarter. I'm wondering if you could help us kind of think about the trajectory of that business over the next couple of quarters? And I think, in the past, you've said that, that should start to really inflect higher as we move into the second half of the year. Just curious if you could help us think about that piece of the business?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/05/26/nvidia-nvda-q1-2023-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,22,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Several data points. We are just starting. We have just started shipping O-RAN in the first quarter of shipping production O-RAN. O-RAN is a robotics processor. It's designed for a software-defined robotic car or robotic pick and placer or a robotic mover, logistics mover. We've been designed into 35 car and trucks and robo taxi companies and more others. If you include logistics movers and last-mile delivery systems and farming equipment and the number of design wins for O-RAN is really quite fantastic. O-RAN is a revolutionary processor. And it's designed as a, if you will, a Data Center on a chip. And it is the first Data Center on a chip that is robotic, processes sensor information, it's safe, it has the ability to be rather resilient as confidential computing. It is designed to be secure, designed to be all those things because these data centers are going to be everywhere. And so O-RAN is really a technological marvels in production. We experienced very likely the lowest auto quarter in some time for some time. And the reason for that is because over the next six years-or-so, we have $11 billion and counting of business that we've secured estimated. And so I think it's a fairly safe thing to say now that O-RAN and our autonomous vehicle and robotics business is going to be our next multibillion dollar business. It's on its way surely there. The robotics and autonomous systems and autonomous machines, whether they move or not move, but AI systems that are at the physical edge is surely going to be the next major computing segment. It is surely going to be the next major Data Center segment. We've been working in this area, as you know, for a decade. We have a fair amount of expertise in this area. And O-RAN is just one example of our work here. We have four pillars to our strategy for autonomous systems. Starting from the data processing and the AI training part of it, to train robotics AIs; second, to simulate robotics AIs, which is omniverse; third, to the memory of the robotics AI otherwise known as mapping; and then finally, the actual robotics application and the robotics processor in the system, and that's where O-RAN goes. But O-RAN is just one of our four pillars of our robotics strategy and the next wave of AI. And so I am really optimistic and really enthusiastic about the next phase of the computer industry's growth. And I think a lot of it is going to be at the edge. A lot of it's going to be about robotics. Operator Thank you.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q1 2023 Earnings Call Transcript,"May 26, 2022","May 1, 2022.",1,23,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, everyone. The full impact and duration of the war in Ukraine and COVID lockdowns in China is difficult to predict. However, the impact of our technology and our market opportunities remain unchanged. The effectiveness of deep learning AI continues to stand. The transformer model, which led to the natural language understanding breakthroughs is being advanced to learn patterns with great spatial, sequential and temporal complexity. Researchers are creating transformer models that are revolutionizing applications from robotics to drug discovery. The effectiveness of deep learning AI is driving companies across industries to adopt NVIDIA for AI computing. We're focused on four major initiatives. First, ramping our next generation of AI infrastructure chips and platforms, Hopper GPU, BlueField DPU, NVLink, InfiniBand, Quantum InfiniBand, Spectrum Ethernet Networking. And all this to help customers build their AI factories and take advantage of new AI breakthroughs like transformers. Second, ramping our system and software industry partners to launch Grace, our first CPU. Third, ramping O-RAN, our new robotics processor, and nearly 40 customers building cars, robo taxis, trucks, delivery robots, logistics robots, farming robots to medical instruments. And fourth, with our software platforms, adding new value to our ecosystem with NVIDIA AI and NVIDIA Omniverse and expanding into new markets with new CUDA acceleration libraries. These initiatives will greatly advance AI. And while continuing to extend this most impactful technology of our time to scientists in every field and companies in every industry.

For Q1, our guidance can include an acceleration of Data Center from where we left in terms of Q4. We will have growth across several of our market platforms within Q1, both Data Center, Gaming, and probably a couple of others. But yes, there is expected to be accelerated growth as we move into Q1.

We have several -- first of all, Toshiya, great to hear from you. We have several growth drivers in data centers. There's hyperscale, public cloud, enterprise core, and enterprise edge. We're seeing growth across the entire spectrum. There are several different use cases that are particularly exciting, large language models -- language, understanding models triggered by the invention of transformers, which is probably one of the most important AI models that's been invented in some time. And conversational AI used for customer service, chatbots, a whole bunch of customer service applications. It can be web-based. It could be point-of-sale base. It could be cloud-based. Recommender systems, deep learning-based recommender systems are making groundbreaking improvements. And cloud graphics, all of the work that we're doing and putting rendering or putting simulations up in the cloud, cloud gaming, Android cloud gaming, are really driving adoption in the cloud. And so, many different use cases across all of the different platforms in data centers. Operator Next, we'll go to C.J.

I'll start on the data center supply. As we discussed last quarter and discussed today, we still have some supply constraints across some of our businesses. Networking in the Data Center business has been supply constrained. We're improving every single day. And we do expect to improve supply each quarter as we enter into fiscal year '23 here. So, that is probably the key area within our Data Center. But from time to time, there can be other focused on do -- so I'll turn the rest of the question to Jensen in terms of how about the rest of the year as well.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,6,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Colette captured it well. We are supply constrained. Our demand is greater than our supply. As you know, our data center product line consists of GPUs and mix, Bluefield DPUs, Quantum, and spectrum switches, HGX, if you will, system component, meaning that the entire motherboard or the entire GP board is delivered in combination because it's so complicated. And so, we have products that span a broad reach of use cases for data centers from training of AI models to inferencing at very large scale, to universal GPUs for public cloud, industry-standard servers, community servers for enterprise use, and supercomputing systems that use InfiniBand and quantum switches. And so, the application space is quite broad. We saw demand constrained pretty much across the entire range. Our operations team did a fantastic job this year, both in executing in all of these complicated products, but also in expanding our supply base. We expect supply to improve each and every quarter going forward. And this quarter, this coming quarter, the Q1 -- the April quarter is, based on guidance that Colette just made, is consistent with an increasing supply base. We expect to still be demand constrained, but our supply base is going to increase this quarter, this next quarter, and pretty substantially in the second half.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,8,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks, Joe. We have a multiple-arm projects ongoing in the company from connected -- for devices to robotics processors such as the new Orin that's going into autonomous vehicles and robotic systems and industrial automation, robotics, and such. Orin is doing incredibly well. It started production. And as we mentioned earlier, it's going to drive an inflection point starting in Q2 but accelerating through Q3 and the several years after as we ramp into all of the electric cars and all of the robotic applications and robotaxis and such. We also have Arm projects with the CPU that you mentioned, Grace. We have Grace, and we surely have the follow-ons to Grace, and you could expect us to do a lot of developments around the Arm architecture. One of the things that's really evolved nicely over the last couple of years is the success that Arm has seen in hyperscalers and data centers. And it's really accelerated and motivated them to accelerate the development of higher-end CPUs. And so, you're going to see a lot of exciting CPUs coming from us. And Grace is just the first example. You're going to see a whole bunch of them beyond that. But our strategy is accelerated computing. That's ultimately what we do for a living. We, as you know, love it where there's any CPUs. If it's an x86 from any vendor. So, long as we have a CPU, we could connect NVIDIA's platform to it and accelerate it for artificial intelligence or computer graphics, robotics, and such. And so, we love to see the expansion of CPU footprints, and we're just thrilled that Arm is now growing into robotics and autonomous vehicles and cloud computing and supercomputing and in all these different applications, and we intend to bring the full spectrum of NVIDIA's accelerated computing platform to NVIDIA Arm CPUs.

Thanks for letting me ask the question. Just on the inventory purchase obligations, I think this was the fourth quarter in a row where you've seen greater than 30% sequential growth and is the first quarter where that number is now eclipsing kind of your quarterly revenue guidance. And so, I guess I'm trying to figure out, to what extent is this just a reflection of how tight things are across the semi industry? To what extent is this the poker tale of kind of how bullish you are on future demand? And relative to your commentary, that supply starts to get better throughout the year, should we expect that number to start to level off?

As mentioned, Orin ramping into autonomous vehicles is brand new. This is the inflection point of us growing into autonomous vehicles. This is going to be a very large business for us going forward. It was already mentioned, Grace is a brand-new product that has never been on NVIDIA's road map. And we already see great success with customers who love the architecture of it and desperately in need of the type of capability that Grace brings.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,12,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. NVIDIA is a software-driven business. Accelerated computing is a software-driven business. It starts from recognizing what domain of applications we want to accelerate and can accelerate and then building an entire stack from the processor to the system to the system software, the acceleration engines, and potentially even the applications itself, like the software that we were mentioning earlier, NVIDIA DRIVE, NVIDIA AI, and NVIDIA Omniverse. These are applications that sit on top of system software and are really valuable to the marketplace. The way to think about our software licensing -- so we've always been a software-driven business. But for the very first time, we have packaged licensable software on -- available to customers. The way that we license software for NVIDIA AI Enterprise is per node of server. There's some 20 million, 25 million servers that are installed in the world today in enterprises, not including clouds. We believe that every single server in the future will be running AI software. And we would like to offer an engine that enables enterprises to be able to use the most advanced the most trusted, the most utilized AI engine in the world. And so, that is essentially the target market, if you will, for NVIDIA AI. The NVIDIA Omniverse is targeting -- is designed for creators contributing content to a virtual world and connect it to robots that are contributing to content in a virtual world. And so, it's based on connections. There are 40 million designers and creators around the world. There are going to be hundreds of millions of robots. Every single car will essentially be a robot someday. And those are connections that will be connected into a digital twin system like Omniverse. And those are -- so the Omniverse business model is per connection per year. And in the case of NVIDIA DRIVE, we share the economics of the software that we deliver, if it's AB software or parking software or cabin-based AI software, whatever the licensing is or whatever the service, if it's an upfront license, we share the economics of that. If it's a monthly service subscription, we share the economics of that. But basically, for the cars that we are part of, that we're developing, the end-to-end service, we will get the benefits of the economics of that for the entire life of the fleet of the car. And so, you could imagine, with 10 million cars, with modern car lifetimes of 10 to 20 years, the economics and the market, the installed opportunity is quite high. And so, our business opportunity is based on those factors. But our software business really, really started several years ago with virtual GPUs, but this year was when we really stepped it up and offered for the very first time NVIDIA AI Enterprise, Omniverse, and DRIVE. And so, I watch the spot, I think this is going to be a very significant business opportunity for us, and we look forward to reporting on it.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,13,Vivek Arya,Bank of America Merrill Lynch -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks for taking my questions. Jensen, in the past, you mentioned about 10% or so adoption rate for AI among your customer base. I was hoping you would quantify where we are in that adoption curve that you tend to differentiate between the adoption differences between your hyperscale and enterprise customers? And then kind of related to that, is there an inorganic element to your growth now that you have over $20 billion of cash on the balance sheet? How are you planning to deploy that to kind of accelerate your growth also?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,14,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. The applications for AI is unquestionably growing, and it's growing incredibly fast. But whether in enterprises and financial services, it could be fraud detection, in cases of consumer pointing businesses, customer service, conversational AI, where people are calling chatbots. But in the future, every website will have a chatbot, every phone number will have a chatbot, whether it's a human in the loop or not human in the loop, we'll have a chatbot. And so, customer service will be heavily, heavily supported by artificial intelligence in the future. Almost every point of sales, I think, whether it's a fast food or a quick service, businesses are going to have chatbots and AI-based customer service. Retail checkouts will be supported by AI agents. And so, all of this is made possible by a couple of breakthroughs, computer vision, of course, because the agents, the AIs have to make eye contact and recognize your posture and such, recognize speech, understand the context and what is being spoken about and have a reasonable conversation with people so that you could provide good customer service. The ability to have human in the loop is one of the great things about an AI much, much more so than a recording, which obviously is not intelligent and therefore it's difficult to, if you will, call your manager or call somebody to provide services that they can't. And so, the number of different applications that have been enabled by natural language understanding in customer service in just the last couple of years has grown tremendously. I think we're -- we remain early days in our adoption. It's incredible how fast it has grown and how many different applications are now possible with AI. It pretty much says that almost all future software will be written with AI or by AI. And when it's done, it will be an AI. And we see it in all these different industries. And so, I'm pretty certain we're in the early innings yet of AI, and this is going to be one of the largest industries of software that we have ever known. With respect to capital, as you know, we had just terminated our Arm agreement. We have a regular capital strategy process, and we'll go through that, and we'll make the best judgment about how to use our capital in helping our growth and sustaining our growth, and accelerating our growth, and we'll have all of those sensible conversations during those capital allocation meetings. We're just delighted to have so much capital. And so, just to put it out there. Operator And next, we'll go to Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Unknown speaker Thanks, guys. This is Michael on behalf of Aaron. Can you guys talk about how the launch of the RTX 3050 is going so far? And maybe more broadly, your view of where we are in the product cycle on gaming? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,15,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, Michael. Let's see. RTX is an unqualified home run. RTX completely reinvented modern computer graphics. It brought forward ray tracing about a decade earlier than anybody thought possible. The combination of RTX with artificial intelligence, which enabled this technology we call DLSS, is able to not only do a ton more computation using our processors but also engage the powerful Tensor for processors that we have in our GPUs to generate images, beautiful images. RTX is being adopted by just every game developer on the planet now. It's being adopted by just about every design tool on the planet now. And if not for RTX, Omniverse wouldn't be possible. We wouldn't be able to do physically based path tracing and simulate sensors like radars and LiDARs and ultrasonics and of course, cameras and simulate these cameras physically and still be able to deliver the type of performance that we deliver. And so, RTX was a game-changer for the industry. It reset modern computer graphics. And it was an enabler for us to build an entire new platform from Omniverse. We're about -- I think about a third of the way through upgrading an installed base that is growing. You know that video games is now the world's largest gaming genre. And Steam, over the last two years, has grown by 50%. The number of concurrent players on Steam has grown tremendously. And in just the last couple of years, a brand-new game store from Epic came on, and it's already a multi-hundred-million-dollar business. I think it's close to $1 billion that they're doing incredibly well. I'm so happy to see it. And so, the overall gaming market is growing and it's growing quite nicely. But the thing that, in addition to resetting computer graphics for our entire installed base, the growing of our installed base because gaming is growing. There are a couple of other growth dynamics that are associated with GeForce and RTX that's really quite brand new. One of them is hybrid work. This is a permanent condition. And we now are seeing across the board people who are designers and creators now have to set up essentially a new workstation or new home workstation design studio so that they could do their work at home. In addition, the creative economy, the digital economy, the creative economy is really, really doing fantastically because everything has to be done in 3D now. Print ads are done in 3D. So, 2D print is done in 3D. Video is done in 3D. In live video broadcast video, the millions of influencers now augment their broadcast with rich augmented reality and 3D graphics. And so, 3D graphics is now not just for video games and 3D content, it's actually used now for all forms of digital content creation. And so, RTX has all of these different drivers working behind it, and we're definitely in the early innings of RTX.

So, you said that the growth in the next quarter is about $450 million, give or take, driven by Data Center. Can you give us some feeling for how that growth is being driven by units versus pricing versus mix and how those drivers might differ between Gaming and Data Center, if at all, for Colette?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,17,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- It's really early in the quarter to determine, Stacy, our exact mix that we will have based on the unit and an ASP -- our overall growth quarter over quarter going into Q1 will be driven by data center primarily. We will see a little bit of growth there in gaming. I think that's important to understand that even after Q4 holiday moving into Q1, we'll still probably see growth in gaming, which is different in terms of what we've seen seasonally. We will probably have growth in automotive as well sequentially between Q4 and Q1. There are still some areas that are so constrained. We are working again to try and improve that for every quarter going forward, but that's how you should look at our earnings for Q1 primarily from Data Center.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,18,Harlan Sur,J.P. Morgan -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Good afternoon, and congratulations on the solid results and execution. The networking connectivity portfolio addition has been pretty solid for the NVIDIA team, especially in enabling scaling of your GPU systems, improving connectivity bottlenecks in yours and your customers' accelerated compute platforms. So, in a year where spending is growing 30%. You've got a strong networking upgrade cycle, which is good for your NIC products and just continued overall good attach rates, if the team can unlock more supply, will the networking connectivity business grow in line or faster than the overall Data Center business this year? And then for Jensen, have you driven synergies between Mellanox's leadership in networking connectivity? And for example, leveraging their capabilities for your internally developed NVLink connectivity and switching architectures?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,19,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes, absolutely. If not for the work that we did so closely with Mellanox, the scalability of DGX and DGX Super Pine and the research supercomputer that was just installed in Meta would just not be possible. The concepts of overlapping networking and compute, moving some -- moving computing into the fabric, into the network, the work that we're doing with Synchronoss and Precision Timing so that we could create Omniverse computers that obey the laws of physics and space-time, these things are just simply not possible. The work that we're doing to bring cloud-native secure multi-tenancy to supercomputing wouldn't have been possible. The number of innovations, that are countless. And so, I am so thrilled with the combination and so through what the work the Mellanox team are doing. We've accelerated road maps as a result of the combination that we could leverage a much larger base of chip design. BlueField's road map has been accelerated probably by about a year. The switch in -- the quantum switch and the spectrum switch, the SerDes are absolutely world-class, shared between Ethernet and InfiniBand and NVLink, absolutely the best servers in the world. And so, the list of opportunities or the list of combination benefits is really quite countless. And so, I'm super thrilled with that. With respect to networking growth, we should be growing. If we weren't supply constrained, we should be growing faster than overall CSP growth. And the reason for that -- the reason for that is twofold. The first is because the networking leadership position of Mellanox, Mellanox is highly heavyweight in the upper end of networking, where the adoption of higher-speed networks tends to move. And so, it's sensible that as new data centers are built, the first preference is to install it with higher-speed networking than the last-generation networking. And Mellanox's networking technology is unambiguously world-class. The second reason is because the areas where the overall NVIDIA is strong has to do with the areas that are growing quite fast, which related to artificial intelligence or cloud AI and such. And so, those different applications are growing faster than the core. And so, it would be sensible that we have the opportunity as we expand our supply base to continue to grow faster than CSPs overall. Operator Our next question will come from Matt Ramsay with Cowen.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,20,Matt Ramsay,Cowen and Company -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Yes, thank you very much. Good afternoon. Jensen, I maybe wanted to expand on some of the things that you were just speaking about in your last answer with respect to the Data Center business. It's not often maybe ever that you have both x86 server vendors having new big platform upgrades in the same year, which will probably happen later this year. There's a lot going on there, PCIe, some CXL stuff. I wonder if you could talk a bit about your Data Center business broadly and what you feel might be memory and I/O constrained currently that these systems might unlock for you both in the cloud and enterprise side, but also in the DGX business. Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,21,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks, Matt. There are several bottlenecks, and let me just highlight some of them. One of the largest bottlenecks is memory speed. And memory speed, that's the reason why we use the fastest memories in the world, HBM and GDDR, etc., etc. We are the largest consumers of the fastest memories in the world and not even by -- there's not -- with no close second that I know. And so, our consumption of fast memories is important to the work that we do. The second is networking performance. It is the reason why we have the fastest networks. It is also the reason why we have the most fastest networks in any system. We will have, for example, eight InfiniBand at the highest speeds connected right into HGX or DGX server. And so, the work that we do in GPU direct memory, RDMA, the work that we do with GPU direct storage, the work that we do with in-network computing and all reductions and moving data around inside the network is absolutely world-class. This is an area that we are just -- I am just incredibly proud. All of that is so that we could be less bottlenecked by the CPU. Remember, inside our DGX system is on CPU and eight GPUs. And the fundamental goal is to offload as much as we can and utilize the resources that we have as much as we can. This year, we expect a transition in PCIe Gen 4 to Gen 5. We are constrained on Gen 4. We'll be constrained on Gen 5, but we're used to that. And that's something that we're very good at. And we'll continue to support Gen 4 well through next year, maybe well through the next couple of years. And all of the installed base of Gen 4 systems that are going to be all over the world, and we'll take advantage of Gen 5 as much as we can. But we have all kinds of new technologies and strategies to improve the throughput of systems and avert the bottlenecks that are there.

Thanks, and congrats on the good quarter and guide. Colette, question on the gross margin and to Jensen's point about really creating a software business driven by Omniverse, DRIVE, and Enterprise. When you're kind of contemplating your margin profile over the next couple of years, how do we think about that? Is it really going to be driven by an increasing mix of software as a percentage of your revenue over time? Is there more margin upside on the hardware side in terms of some of your segments? The software opportunity is very exciting, but I'm just curious how that would translate to your kind of more of a longer-term margin profile. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2022/02/17/nvidia-nvda-q4-2022-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,23,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yes. Thanks for the question on gross margin and the long term. When we think about the long-term gross margin, we have incorporated software in many of our platforms even today, meaning our high-value platforms in data center or for the purpose of our business, have really helped us with our gross margins to this point, and we've done a really solid job of managing that and the growth over the years. I believe these businesses will continue to be a growing opportunity for us, but now also with the ability to package up -- so as that scales with our Enterprise customers, in the Data center, and with our already procured deals, look, we've got a great opportunity to fill in the future and the margin needs to come. So, we're going to work on that. We've set the stage for having been able to package it up to be able to sell it separately to create the business model, to create the partners that are helping us sell it. But yes, we do believe this will be a driver in the long term. Operator Thank you.

NVIDIA,Nvidia (NVDA) Q4 2022 Earnings Call Transcript,"Feb 17, 2022","December 31, 2021.",1,24,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Thanks, everyone. The tremendous demand for our computing platforms, NVIDIA RTX, NVIDIA HPC, and NVIDIA AI, drove a great quarter, capping a record year. Our work propels advances in AI, digital biology, climate sciences, gaming, creative design to autonomous vehicles and robotics, and some of today's most impactful fields. Our open computing platform optimized across the full stack, architecture for data center scale is adopted by customers globally from cloud to core to edge and robotics. I am proud of the NVIDIA operations team as we make substantial strides in broadening our supply base to scale our company and better serve customer demand. And this year, we introduced new software business models with NVIDIA AI Enterprise, NVIDIA Omniverse, and NVIDIA DRIVE. NVIDIA DRIVE is a full-stack end-to-end platform that serves the industry with AV chips, data center infrastructure for AI and simulation, mapping, and the autonomous driving application service. Our data center infrastructure is used by just about anybody building AVs, robotics robotaxis, shuttles, and trucks. EV companies have selected our Orin chip across the world. And our partnership with Mercedes-Benz and Jaguar Land Rover has opened up a new software and services business model for millions of cars for the life of the fleet. NVIDIA Omniverse is a world simulation engine that connects simulated digital worlds to the physical world. Omniverse is a digital twin, a simulation of the physical world. The system can be a building a factory, a warehouse, a car, a fleet of cars, a robotic factory orchestrating a fleet of robots building cars that are themselves robotic. Today's Internet is 2D and AI is in the cloud. The next phase of Internet will be 3D and AI will be connected to the physical world. We created Omniverse to enable the next wave of AI where AI and robotics touches our world. Omniverse can sound like science fiction, but there are real-world use cases today. Hundreds of companies are evaluating Omniverse. We can't wait to share more of our progress at next month's GTC, learn about new chips, new computing platforms, new AI and robotic breakthroughs, and the new frontiers of Omniverse. Hear from the technologists of Deloitte, Epic Games, Mercedes-Benz, Microsoft, Pfizer, Sony, Visa, Walt Disney, Zoom, and more. This GTC promises to be our most exciting developers conference ever. We had quite a year, yet nothing makes me more proud than the incredible people who have made NVIDIA one of the best companies to work for and the company where they do their lives' work. We look forward to updating you on our progress next quarter. Thank you.

Jensen, I'm wondering how much of the strength that you're seeing in gaming and data center is, you know, maybe more temporary because COVID or, you know, some customer pull-ins in the data center or so forth? And how much of it is more structural and more secular that can continue even once we get into, hopefully, you know, sooner rather than later, into a more normalized period for the industry?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,2,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Vivek, thank you. So first of all, we didn't see pull-ins, and we're in the beginning of our brand-new product cycle with Ampere, and so the vast majority of the data center growth came from that. The gaming industry, they -- with all that's happening around the world, and it's really unfortunate, but it's made gaming the largest entertainment medium in the world. More than ever, people are spending time digitally, spending on time -- spending their time in video games. The thing that people haven't realized about video games is that it's not just the game itself anymore. The variety of different ways that you can play, whether you can hang out with your friends in Fortnite, go to a concert in Fortnite, building virtual worlds in Minecraft, you're spending time with your friends, you're using it to create and to realize your imaginations. People are using it for broadcast, for sharing ideas and techniques with other people. And so -- and then of course, it's just an incredibly fun way to spend time, even by consumption of the video -- of a video game. And so, there's just so much that you could do with video games now. And I think that this way of enjoying entertainment digitally has been accelerated as a result of the pandemic, but I don't think it's going to return. Video game adoption has been going up over time and pretty steadily. And PC is now the single largest entertainment platform -- is the largest gaming platform. And GeForce is now the largest gaming platform in the world. And as I mentioned, it's not just about gaming. There's just so many different ways that you could enjoy games. With data center, the things that -- the structural change that's happening in data center are coupled with different dynamics that are happening at the same time. The first dynamic, of course, is the movement to the cloud. The way that a cloud data center is built and the way that an enterprise data center or a cluster is built is fundamentally different. And it's really, really beneficial to have the ability to accelerate applications that cloud service providers would like to offer, which is basically everything. And we know that one of the most important applications of today is artificial intelligence. It's a type of software that really wants acceleration. And NVIDIA's GPU acceleration is the perfect medium, perfect platform for it. And then the last reason about the data center is the -- this architectural change from hosting applications to hosting services that's driving this new type of architecture called disaggregation versus hyper converged. And the original name of hyperscalers is a large data center of a whole bunch of hyperconverged computers. But the computers of today are really disaggregated. A single application service could be running on multiple servers at the same time, which generates a ton of east-west traffic, and a lot of it is artificial intelligence neuro network models. And so, because of this type of architecture, two components, two types of technologies are really important to the future of cloud. One of them, as I mentioned, was -- is acceleration, and our GPU is ideal for it. And then the other one is high-speed networking. And the reason for that is because the server is now disaggregated, the application is fractionalized and broken up into this -- in a bunch of small pieces that are running across the data center. And whenever an application needs to send parts of the answer to another server for the microservice to run. That transition is called east-west traffic. And the most important thing you could possibly do for yourself is to buy really high-speed, low-latency networking. And that's what Mellanox is fantastic at. And so, we find ourselves really in this perfect condition where the future is going to be more virtual, more digital, and that's why -- that's the reason why GeForce is so successful. And then we find ourselves in a world where the future is going to be more autonomous and more AI-driven. And that's the benefit of our GPUs. And then, lastly, cloud microservice transactions really benefit high-speed networking, and that's where Mellanox comes in. And so, I think that this is -- the dynamics that I'm describing are permanent, and it's just been accelerated to the present, you know, because of everything that's happening to us. But this is the future, and it's not -- there's no going back. It's -- and we just found everything accelerated. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your line is open.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,3,Timothy Arcuri,UBS -- Analyst,analyst,"-- Thanks a lot. Jensen, I guess I had a question on both architecture and also manufacturing. And I think on the manufacturing side, you've been, you know, radical on that for some time. And when you've been asked in the past about moving to more of a tiled or chiplet approach, you sort of made light of that. But the CPU guys are clearly picking that approach. So, I guess, the question is why do you think you won't have to make a similar move? And then on the side of architecture, the theme of Hot Chips this week was really how compute demand is far outstripping computing power? And then we see this, you know, talk about you and ARM. So, I guess can you talk about whether GPU is the future and, you know, maybe the broader opportunity to integrate CPU and GPU? Thanks.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,4,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. We push architecture really hard. And the way we push architecture is we start from the system. But we believe that the future computer company is a data center-scale company. The computing unit is no longer a microprocessor or even a server or even a cluster. The computing unit is an entire data center now. And as I was explaining it to Vivek just now that a microservice that we're enjoying hundreds of billions of transactions a day, those are broken up into a whole bunch of microservices that are running across the entire data center. And so, the data center is running -- the entire data center is running an application. I mean, that's pretty remarkable thing. And that happened in the last several years. We were ahead of this trend, and we recognized that, you know, as a computing company, we have to be a data center-scale company, and we architect from that [Inaudible]. If you look at our architecture, we were the first in the world to create the concept of an NVLink, with eight processors being fully synchronized across the computing node, and we created the DGX. We recognize the importance of high-speed networking and low-latency networking, and that's why we bought Mellanox. And the amount of software that we invented along the way to make it possible for low-latency communications, whether it's GPUDirect or, recently, the invention of GPUDirect Storage, all of that technology was inspired by the idea that you have to think about the data center all in one holistic way. And then in the last -- in this current generation with Ampere, we invented the world's first multi-instance GPU. We invented the world's first multi-instance GPU, which means that our Ampere GPU could simultaneously be one GPU or, with NVlink, eight GPUs combined, working together, So you could – you know, GPUs are working harmoniously together. Or each one of the GPUs could fractionalize itself, if you don't need that much GPU working on your workload, fractionalize into a multi-GPU instance, we call the MIG, a little tiny instance. And each one of those tiny instances are more powerful and more performant than our entire Volta GPU lap time. And so, whether you like to fractionalize the GPU, which happens oftentimes, create a larger GPU using NVLink, or create an even larger GPU, the size of DGX POD, connected together with high-speed, low-latency networking with Mellanox, we could architect it any way you'd like. You made a comment about -- you asked a question about ARM. We've been a long-term partner of ARM, and we use ARM in a whole bunch of applications. And whether it's autonomous driving or a robotics application, the Nintendo Switch, console business that we're in. And then, recently, we brought CUDA to ARM and to bring accelerated computing to ARM. And so, we worked with the ARM team very closely. They're really great guys. And one of the specials about the ARM architecture that you know very well is that it's incredibly energy-efficient. And because it's energy-efficient, it has the headroom to scale into very high-performance levels over time. And so, anyways, we love working with the ARM guys.

Congratulations on the quarter. Just building on some prior questions. The first one, I was just curious if you could help us appreciate kind of the installed base of the gaming GPU business, you know, relative to where we're at the Turing upgrade cycle, you know, what do we see still on prior generations, be it Pascal or before? And then secondly, I was wondering, you know, Colette, could you just give me a kind of updated commentary or views on visibility in the data center business? How that – you know, how has that changed over the last three months? What does that look like as you look through the back half of the calendar year? Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,6,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks a lot, Aaron. We are -- we're still in the ramping of the RTX generation. Turing, Turing the current generation that we're in, is the world's first ray tracing GPU. And it fuses -- the RTX technology fuses three fundamental technologies: the programmable shader that we introduced a long time ago that revolutionized computer graphics, and we added two new technologies. One technology is a ray tracing acceleration core that makes the tracing of rays and looking for intersections between the ray and the scene -- objects in scene super, super fast. And that's -- it's a complicated problem. It's a super complicated problem. We want it to be running concurrently to shading so that the ray traversal and the shading of the pixels could be done independently and concurrently. The second thing is we invented this technology to bring AI, artificial intelligence, using this new type of algorithm called deep learning to computer graphics. And one example of its capability is the algorithm we introduced called DLSS, Deep Learning Super Sampling, which allows us to essentially synthesize by learning from previous examples, essentially learning from previous examples of images and remembering it, remembering what beautiful images look like so that when you take a low-resolution image, and you run it through the deep neural network, it synthesizes a high-resolution image that's really, really beautiful. And people have commented that it's even more beautiful than native rendered images at the native resolution. And the benefit is not only is it beautiful, it's also super fast. We essentially nearly doubled the performance of RTX as a result of doing that. So, you can have the benefit of ray tracing as well as very high resolution and very high speed. And so that's called RTX. And Turing is probably not even close, not even one-third of the total installed base of all of our GeForce GPUS, which is, as you know, the single-largest installed base of gaming platforms in the world. And so, we support this large installed base, and we're in the process of bringing them to the future with RTX. And now, with the new console generation coming, every single game developer on the planet is going to be doing ray tracing, and they're going to be creating much, much richer content. And because of multi-platform, cross-platform play, and because of the size of the gaming platform, PC gaming platform, it's really important that these game developers bring the latest generation content to PCs, which is great for us.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,8,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Let me see if I can answer this one for you. Yes, we have been talking about our visibility of data center. And as you've seen in our Q2 results, you can see that our overall adoption of the NVIDIA computing portfolio has accelerated quite nicely. But keep in mind, we're still really early in the product cycle. A100 is ramping. It's ramping very strong into our existing installed bases but also into new markets. Right now, A100 probably represents less than a quarter of our data center revenues. So we still have a lot to grow. We have good visibility looking into Q3 with our hyperscales. We have a little bit more of a mixed outlook in terms of our vertical industries, given a lot of the uncertainty in the market and in terms of the overall economy. On-premises are challenged because of the overall COVID. But remember, industries are quickly and continuing to adopt and move to the overall cloud. But overall, we do expect a very strong Q3.

I guess two questions. If I look at your outstanding inventory purchase obligations, grew 17% sequentially. Is that – you know, as you prepare for the September 1 launch? And can you kind of comment on gaming visibility into the back half of the year? And then the second question, Jensen, you know, I know you're very focused on platforms and driving recurring revenues. I would love to hear if there's any, you know, particular platforms over the last three months where you've made real headway or get you excited, whether Jarvis, Merlin, Spark or whatever.

NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,10,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thanks so much, C.J. We're expecting a really strong second half for gaming. I think this may very well be one of the best gaming seasons ever. And the reason for that is because PC gaming has become such a large format. The combination of amazing games like Fortnite and Minecraft and because of the way people game now, their gaming and their e-sporting, even F1 is an e-sport now, they're hanging out with friends. They're using it to create other content. They're using, you know, game captures, create art. They're sharing it with the community. It's a broadcast medium. The number of different ways you could game has just really, really exploded. And it works on PCs because all the things that I described, you know, require cameras or keyboards or streaming systems and -- but it requires an open system that is multitasking. And so, the PC has just become such a large platform for gaming. And the second thing is that RTX, it's a home run. You know, we really raised the bar with computer graphics, and the games are so beautiful, and it's really, really the next level. It's not been this amazing since we introduced programmable shaders about 15 years ago. And so, for the last 15 years, we've been making programmable shaders better and better and better, and it has been getting better. But there's never been a giant leap like this. And RTX brought both artificial intelligence as well as ray tracing to PC gaming. And then the third factor is the console launch. There's -- people are really -- the game developers are really gearing up for a big leap. And, you know, because of the gaming -- because how vibrant the gaming market is right now and how many people around the world is depending on gaming at home, I think it's going to be the most amazing season ever. We're already seeing amazing numbers from our console partner, Nintendo. Switch has -- about to sell more than Super Nintendo, more than all the Famicom. I mean -- which was one of the best gaming consoles of all time. I mean, they're on their way to make Switch the most successful gaming platform of all time. And so, I'm super excited for them. And so, I think it's going to be quite a huge second half of the year. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Toshiya Hari of Goldman Sachs.

Good afternoon, and thank you so much for taking the question. I had one for Jensen and another one for Colette. Just following up on the data center business. As you probably know, quite a few of your peers have been talking about potential digestion of capacity on the part of your hyperscale customers over the next, call it, six to 12 months. Curious, is that something that you think about, worry about in your data center business? Or do you have enough idiosyncratic growth drivers like the A100 ramp? And I guess, the breadth that you've built within your data center business across compute and networking, are those enough for you to buck the trend within data center over the next six to 12 months? And then the second one for Colette, just on gross margins. You're guiding October-quarter gross margins down 50 basis points sequentially. Based on the color that you provided for the individual segments, it looks like mix remains pretty positive. So just curious what's driving the marginal decline in gross margins in the October quarter. Thank you.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,17,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. Thank you. So -- and thanks for the question. The -- our data center trend is really tied to a few factors. One is the proliferation of using deep learning and artificial intelligence and all the services are -- that are in -- by the cloud service providers. And I think it's fair to say that over the last several years, the number of breakthroughs in artificial intelligence has been really terrific. And we're seeing anywhere from 10x times -- 10x more computational requirement each year to more than that. And so, in the last three years, we've seen somewhere between 1,000 to 3,000x increase in the size of models, the computational requirement necessary to create these AI models and to deploy these AI models. And so, the No.1 trend that we are -- we're probably indexed to is the breakthroughs of AI and the usefulness of AI and how people are using it. And one of the -- and I remember C.J.'s question now, and I'll answer this along with that. One of the things that we look for and you should look for is how -- what kind of breakthroughs are based on deep learning and based on AI that these services all demand. And there are three big ones, just gigantic one. Of course, one of them is natural language understanding. The ability to take a very complicated text and use deep learning to create essentially a dimension reduction, it's called deep embedding, dimension reduction on that body of text so that you could use that vector as a way to teach a recommender system, which is the second major breakthrough, the recommender system, how to predict and make a recommendation to somebody. Recommendation on ads and videos. And there are trillions of videos on the web. You need ways to recommend them, both the news and just the amount of information that is going to -- that is in true dynamic form require these recommenders to be instantaneous. And so, the first one is natural language understanding. The second one is the recommender system, gigantic breakthroughs in the last several years. And the third is conversational AI. I mean, we're going to have conversational engines that are just super clever. And they can predict what you're about to ask. They're going to predict the right answer for you, make recommendations to you based on the three pillars that I just described. And I haven't even started talking about robotics, the breakthroughs that are happening there with all the factories that need to automate. And breakthroughs that we're seeing in self-driving cars, the models there are really improving fast. And so, the answer to you, Toshiya, and C.J. are kind of similar, that on the first one, we're indexed to AI. The second, we're indexed to breakthroughs of AI. So that it can continue to consume more and more capability and more technology. And then the third thing that we're indexed to is the movement of workloads to the cloud. It is now possible to do rendering in the cloud, remote graphics workstations in the cloud. And NVIDIA virtual workstations is in every single cloud. You could do big data analytics in the cloud. And these applications, I've just given you a few applications where you can do scientific computing in the cloud. These applications all have fundamentally different computing architectures. NVIDIA is the only accelerated architecture that allows you to do microservices for conversational AI and other types of AI applications to scale up applications like high-performance computing, training, big data analytics to virtualize applications like workstations. Our platform is universal. And these three facts that I just described are supremely complex, virtualized, microservices-based, and scale-up-based. And so, these – bare-metal scale-up. And these are complicated, and it's one of the reasons why we bought Mellanox because they're at the core and at the intersection of all of that. The storage, the networking, the security, the virtualization, they're at the intersection of all of that. And I just described three dynamics that are very, very powerful and are at the early stages yet. And so those are the things that we're really indexed to. And then lastly, when somebody adopts -- when we introduce a new platform like Ampere, we're in the beginning of a multiyear product cycle, Ampere is such a gigantic breakthrough. It's the first universal GPU we ever created. It is both able to scale up as well as scale out, scale up as in multi GPUs, scale out is fractionalization, multi-instance GPUs. And it's -- it reduced -- it saves money, tremendous amount of money for people who use it. It speeds up their application. It reduces their TCO. Their TCO value just goes through the roof. And so, we're in the beginning of this multiyear cycle and the enthusiasm has been fantastic. This is the fastest ramp we've ever had. And so, we're going to keep on racing through the second half.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,18,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- OK. And, Toshiya, you asked a question regarding our guidance going forward regarding gross margin. And within our Q3 guidance, we have just a small decline in our gross margin from Q2. Most of that is really associated with mix, but also a little bit in terms of the ramping of our new Ampere architecture products that we have. So, keep in mind, our data center will likely be a lower percentage of total revenue, given the strong overall gaming growth that we expect between Q2 and Q3. Within that gaming growth, keep in mind, consoles are also included, which will continue to be below our company totals average gross margin, and that is expected to be up strongly quarter over quarter for our overall console shipments. We're going to be ramping those new architectures over time when we have the ability to expand our gross margin as Ampere GPUs mature, too.

I wanted to dig into data center a little bit. This is a question for Colette. So, in the quarter, ex Mellanox, data center was up, core data center, maybe 6%, 7%. The guide looks to be roughly similar to that into Q3. Can you talk to us a little bit about what's driving the trajectory? Are you more demand- or more supply limited at this point? What does your supply situation look like? And what are the lead times especially on the A100 products for data center look like at this point? Like if you have more capacity available, do you think you'd have like a stronger trajectory than you have right now?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

Stacy, so thanks for the question. Let me first start on our Q3 outlook and what we're seeing. And when we think about our demand and our supply, we're very comfortable with the supply that we have. Keep in mind, our products are quite complex, and a lot of our time is spent in terms of procuring every aspect of that supply over multiple quarters previously. So that's how we work. But we are very confident with the overall supply that we have across the board in data center. Keep in mind that it's not just A100. We are continuing to sell V100, T4. And we're also bringing new versions of the A100 coming to overall market. So, I hope that helps you understand our statements on where are we at in terms of the Q3 guidance. We'll see if Jensen wants to add a little bit more to that.",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/

Within the data center guidance, how do you think about like the core data center sequential growth versus Mellanox?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,23,Colette Kress,Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer,company,"-- Yeah. So, in terms of moving from Q2 to Q3, we believe that most of the actual growth that we will receive in that single -- low single-digit to mid-single-digit growth will likely stem from NVIDIA compute will be the largest driver of that. Operator Your next question comes from the line of Joseph Moore with Morgan Stanley.

But you guys haven't really felt the need to be first on seven-nanometer, and you've done very well. Just how important do you think it is to be early in the new process node? And how does that factor into the cycle of innovation at NVIDIA?",https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2020/08/20/nvidia-nvda-q2-2021-earnings-call-transcript/
NVIDIA,NVIDIA (NVDA) Q2 2021 Earnings Call Transcript,"Aug 20, 2020","June 30, 2020.",1,25,Jensen Huang,President and Chief Executive Officer,company,"-- Yeah. First of all, thanks, Joe. The process technology is a lot more complex than a number. I think people have simplified it down to almost a ridiculous level, right? And so, process technology, we have a really awesome process engineering team. World-class. Everybody will recognize that it's absolutely world-class. And we work with the foundries, we work with TSMC really closely, to make sure that we engineer transistors that are ideal for us and we engineer metallization systems that's ideal for us. It's a complicated thing, and we do it at high part. Then the second part of it is where architecture, where the process technology and the rest of the design process, the architecture of the chip, and the final analysis, what NVIDIA paid for, is architecture, not procurement of transistors. We're paid for architecture. And there's a vast difference between our architecture and the second-best architecture and the rest of the architectures. The difference is incredible. We are easily twice the energy efficiency all the time, irrespective of the number of the -- in the transistor side. And so, it must be more complicated than that. And so, we put a lot of energy into that. And then the last thing I would say is that going forward, it's really about data center-scale computing. Going forward, you optimize at the data center scale. And the reason why I know this for a fact is because if you're a software engineer, you would be sitting at home right now and you will write a piece of software that runs on the entire data center in the cloud. You have no idea what's underneath it, nor do you care. And so, what you really want is to make sure that, that data center is as high throughput as possible. There are a lot of code in there. And so, what NVIDIA has decided to do over the years is to take our game to a new level. Of course, we start with building the world's best processors, and we use the world's best foundries, and we partnered them very closely to engineer the best process for us. We partner with the best packaging companies to create the world's best packaging. We're the world's first user of cobots. And whether it's -- I think we're -- I'm pretty sure we're still the highest volume by far of 2.5D and 3D packaging. And so, we start from a great chip. We start from a great chip, but we don't end there. That's just the beginning for us. Now we take this thing all the way through systems, the system software, algorithms, networking, all the way up to the entire data center. And the difference is absolutely shocking. You know, we built our data center, Selene, and it took us four weeks. We put up Selene in four weeks' time. It is the seventh-fastest supercomputer in the world, one of the fastest AI supercomputers in the world. It's the most energy-efficient supercomputer in the world, and it broke every single record in MLPerf. And that kind of shows you something about the scale that we work and the complexity of the work that we do. And this is our -- the future. It's for -- the future is about data centers. Operator We have no further questions at this time.
